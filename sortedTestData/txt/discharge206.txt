Patient Status
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Pt. is **AGE[in 80s] y/o man with PMHx of BPH , Afib , HTN , left pleural effusion s/p VATS and pleuradesis , AVR , and CAD s/p CABG x2 and stent placement who presents from urology clinic c/o fluctuating fevers and chills .
Pt. reports a 10 day history of F/C and difficulty voiding for which he initially presented to **INSTITUTION and was treated for a UTI .
Pt. also reports a 2 week h/o urinary retention requiring intermittent straight catheterizations which he did himself using nonsterile technique .
At Mercy he was treated with Levaquin and ampicillin which he was discharged on .
However , he continued to have elevated temperatures and returned to Mercy where he was placed on IV gentamicin and vancomycin .
Pt. was still febrile and left Mercy , continuing to take his Levaquin until a visit to the urology clinic earlier on the day of admission .
He was sent to the ED at **INSTITUTION where a CT abdomen and pelvis was done , blood and urine cultures were sent off .
A foley catheter was placed .
He was treated with Ciprofloxacin in the ED .
He currently denies F / C / CP / SOB .
No diarrhea , No N / V .
No change in mental status .
Records from Mercy showed negative blood cultures taken on different dates and a urine culture showing only 60,000 Candida , no bacteria .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
1. Fever - Throughout the hospital course , the patient experienced low grade temperature spikes as high as 101.6 .
He was initially started on Zosyn as we awaited blood and urine cultures from the ED and reports to be sent from Mercy hospital .
After information from Mercy was received , the patient was also started on Diflucan 400 mg PO for the first night , then 200 mg PO for a 2 week course .
Zosyn was discontinued .
Although the only pathogen isolated was Candida , it is well accepted that fungal urinary tract infections and pyelonephritis rarely present with symptoms and that this seemed an odd presentation for fungal UTI .
As the patient continued to have low grade febrile spikes , ID was consulted .
CT abd and pelvis done in the ED showed what appeared to possibly be a small right sided fluid collection around the right kidney and right ureteritis .
There was some discussion as to whether or not the perinephric fluid could be sampled by interventional radiology , but after discussions with ID and Urology , it was not deemed large enough .
He was continued on Diflucan and his urinary fungal infection was shown to clear on repeat urinalyses and urine cultures .
He continued to have low grade fevers with occasional sweats and chills , however , no other symptoms .
There was no CVA tenderness on exam .
A repeat CT abd / pelvis on 1/25 showed no significant change with possibly improving right perinephric fluid collection .
On the day of discharge , the patient was afebrile , but was told he could continue to expect low grade fevers until there was either
1. complete resolution of his fungal infection or
2. he underwent definitive urologic surgical intervention to relieve BPH causing chronic right sided retention and inflammation .
Other sources of possible infection in this gentleman with significant cardiopulmonary history include
1. an infected pleural effusion or
2. endocarditis .
The patient reported no symptoms consistent with either of these two scenarios .
And negative blood cultures done throughout this admission argue strongly against endocarditis .
Furthermore , the patient had a TTE done at Mercy earlier this month which showed no vegetations or other indications of endocarditis .
( Report was faxed and placed in the patient 's paper chart ) .
The pleural effusion could still be infected and the option was given to the patient as to whether he wanted to have the fluid sampled .
In consultation with the primary team and with Infectious Disease , it was determined by all involved that the procedure would be low - yield .
The patient opted against it at this time , but should the fevers persist despite completion of antifungal treatment and urologic intervention , he was made aware that this may be necessary in the future .
He will follow up with ID after he completes 2 weeks of diflucan ( i.e. 1 week after discharge ) .
If still no further sources of fever are discovered , then the patient would benefit from a workup for fever of unknown origin .
His primary care physician may opt to go ahead with this workup on an outpatient basis .
2. BPH - The patient required a foley during his entire hospital stay .
He underwent a cystoscopy on 1/18 to rule out bladder carcinoma which could have been the source of his hematuria and fevers .
Cystoscopy showed right hydroureter which was relieved by alleviating the outflow obstruction secondary to BPH and no bladder carcinoma .
The patient 's urologist , Dr. **NAME[VVV] , recommended a chronic foley until follow up in 1 week after discharge .
He is also planning on surgical intervention in the future to more definitively treat the enlarged prostate .
Pt. was given these instructions at the time of discharge .
3. HTN - Well controlled on home medications .
4. Afib - Pt. was anticoagulated with Heparin gtt until after cystoscopy .
He was placed back on Coumadin following the procedure .
It was noted that Diflucan and Warfarin interact which may make the pt 's INR supratherapeutic as long as he is taking the Coumadin .
Goal for this patient with AVR is 2.5-3.5 .
Since the patient had received 6 doses of diflucan prior to discharge , he was given 8 more days of diflucan .
We monitored his INR closely while he was inpatient .
While on Diflucan and Coumadin 2.5 mg PO qHS , his INR reached a maximum of 2.9 .
On the day of discharge , INR was 2.8 .
He was given instructions and a prescription to have his INR checked on 1/25 , 1/29 , and 1/31 with results faxed to Dr. **NAME[ZZZ] , who will be the patient 's PCP .
The patient should complete his diflucan on **DATE[Dec 1 07] and has follow up scheduled with ID and urology at that time .
