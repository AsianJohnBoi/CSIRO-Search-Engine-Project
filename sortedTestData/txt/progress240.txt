He does seem to use his abdominal muscles for respiration .
His lower extremities reveal that there is some trace dependent edema .
He is moving all four extremities .
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN :
1. MRSA infection .
It looks like that we have may have cleared his cultures .
We are going to wait another day .
If his cultures remain negative , then we will consider getting him a new line and remove the one in his neck and in case that one is infected , we will continue his current antibiotic regimen at this time .
2. Hyperglycemia .
He seems to have high sugars during the day .
We are going to add some regular insulin with his meals and may need routine insulin nightly and see if he has improvement in his glucoses .
3. Heart failure .
He is on ACE inhibitor and beta blocker , and we will adjust those medications as tolerated .
4. Increased creatinine .
There is slight increase in his creatinine today .
We will recheck his vancomycin trough level with his next dose .
His case was discussed in detail with the house staff .
I agree with their notes written .
