I personally interviewed and examined the patient .

He is alert and oriented .
He is no acute distress .
Chest is clear .

Abdomen , no tenderness .
Extremities , no edema or tenderness .
LABORATORY DATA :
Laboratory tests have not been obtained because he his major issue has been control of back pain .
PROBLEMS :
1. Back pain .
This is due to compression fractures .
He is in significant pain .
Our plan is to continue him on narcotics .
We will get Pain Service evaluation involved .
A brace will be placed .

Our hope is that we can discharge him today .
So our plan is if we can control his pain and get him a good regimen .
He will be discharged to be followed in PACT .

During the hospitalization , abdominal pain has been stable , as he has no ascites .
His abdominal distention has been stable .
