I have been requested by the trauma team to take care of this gentleman who is status post surgery for incarcerated hernia .
I am managing this patient 's respiratory failure .
On my examination today , he opens his eyes to painful stimuli and does not follow commands on a consistent basis .
Examination of the heart reveals S1 and S2 present .
The lungs reveal diminished breath sounds at both bases .
The abdomen is softer and nontender .
With regards to my plan today , I wanted to wean him off the vent .
However , on placing him on CPAP trials multiple times , the patient became apneic despite stopping all his sedation .
My plan is to , hence , leave him on a lower rate on assist control and see if he will breathe spontaneously as he wakes up .
My goal is to try to extubate him later today .
I have continued his stress ulcer prophylaxis and DVT prophylaxis .
I have replaced his electrolytes appropriately , including his K and magnesium .
This is a vent management note for **DATE[Aug 15 2007] .
