I am managing this critically ill **AGE[in 40s]- year - old male with pancreatitis complicated by development of phlegmon and superior mesenteric artery aneurysm .
He is status post repair , now transferred back to the intensive care unit for fever , chills , rigor with presumed sepsis .
Over the course of the evening , he has become progressively more hypoxemic and required intubation .
I have seen and examined the patient , reviewed his laboratory , radiographic , and EMTEK data , and discussed the management with the general surgeons and with the infectious disease consultants .
His problems and management are as follows :
1. Sepsis :
The etiology of his deterioration is unclear , but he appears to be septic at T max of 39.3 .
Of note , he was complaining of abdominal pain prior to intubation .
LFT s show an obstructive pattern , and a dye study through the drain appears to show , to my read , a leak through the common bile duct .
Currently , we have consulted the GI / Hepatology service , as well as the hepatic surgeons to evaluate .
In the meantime , I have started him empirically on broad spectrum gram - negative and gram - positive coverage for ID 's recommendations .
I am awaiting definitive recommendations from the hepatologist and the surgeons about the possibility of source control with the drainage , either percutaneously or open .
His hemodynamics have been stable , and I have not needed to start him on vasopressors , although he has required multiple fluid boluses for hypotension .
2. Respiratory failure :
Chest x-ray last night developed rapid occurrence of bilateral fluffy infiltrates consistent with ARDS .
He is now on the ventilator .
I have dropped his tidal volumes from 550 to 450 today and then again down to 350 to get him at 6 ml / kilogram .
Peak airway pressures have remained less than 30 .
I have been able increase his PEEP to 12 and wean his FiO2 down gradually to 60% .
I have left him on a Fentanyl infusion for pain control with intermittent Versed for sedation .
Total critical care time equals 40 minutes .
