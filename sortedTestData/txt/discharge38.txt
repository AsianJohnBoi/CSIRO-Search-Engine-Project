ATTENDING PHYSICIAN :
**NAME[TTT M SSS]
ADMISSION DATE :
**DATE[Nov 12 2007]
DISCHARGE DATE :
**DATE[Nov 18 2007]
ADDENDUM :
I discussed with both the sisters **NAME[RRR] and **NAME[QQQ] , and I had discussed with them extensively regarding how sick the patient was and how emergent that she needs to be intubated .
But both the sisters had discussed among themselves , and they had expressed their wish that they do not want their mother to be intubated or to be on ventilation , but however , they agreed for all the other intervention other than do not intubate and not put her on ventilation .
The patient is struggling to breathe at this time , and she is tachypneic , and she might have to be intubated right now but ; however , the patient 's family did not wish the patient to be intubated even after I explained to them that she could potentially die if she was not on a breathing machine ; but however , the patient 's family stressed to me again and wished that they do not want her mother to be on a breathing machine .
They do not want her to be intubated even though it is only a temporary measure where she does not have to be on the breathing machine for long .
It would be only a temporary measure until she can maintain her airway and then they can extubate her .
I explained to her that it is only going to be a short - term temporary measure , and after her pneumonia gets better , she could probably be extubated but even then , she did not wish her mother to be intubated .
