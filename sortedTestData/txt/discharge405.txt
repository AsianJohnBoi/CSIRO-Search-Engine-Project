**INSTITUTION COURSE :
Ms. **NAME[AAA] is a **AGE[in 70s]- year - old female with a history of COPD and asthma who presents with shortness of breath , worse for the last day .
In addition , the staff at the nursing home where she resides noted a low oxygen saturation and sent her to **INSTITUTION .
During her stay at **INSTITUTION , Ms. **NAME[AAA] has remained stable .
For her COPD , she was put on Mucomyst , DuoNebs , and oral prednisone .
For her left lower lobe pneumonia , she was initially started on azithromycin but was then switched to Avelox .
She remained afebrile throughout her stay .
Initially she required 6 L of oxygen per minute by face mask .
By the time of discharge , she was weaned down to 4 L of oxygen per minute through her Oxymizer .
By the time of discharge , the patient stated that her shortness of breath was greatly improved from when she was first admitted .
She denied fever , chills , or pain .
Her white blood count was slightly elevated during her second and third days of admission .
This could be secondary to prednisone ; however , she had a normal white blood count by the time of discharge .
Regarding her right lower lobe mass , the patient continues to refuse bronchoscopy and further workup .
For her diabetes , Ms. **NAME[AAA] was started on 10 units of Lantus subcu at bedtime .
However , her blood sugars remain uncontrol and were as high as more than 500 .
Because of this , we increased her Lantus gradually .
By the time of discharge , her Lantus was 16 units subcu nightly .
In addition , she was also placed on an insulin - sliding scale during her stay here .
She was seen by Speech Pathology , which recommended aspiration precautions as well as thickened liquids .
However , the patient refused both and at the time of discharge she was on a regular diet which she tolerated well .
The patient also suffered from insomnia during her stay here .
She was initially started on Benadryl because it was thought that this would provide minimal respiratory sedation effects .
However , the patient refused this medication and called the physician on call at night who prescribed Restoril .
For her hypertension and hypothyroidism , she was continued on her home medications .
Lovenox and Protonix were started for DVT and peptic ulcer disease prophylaxis , respectively .
