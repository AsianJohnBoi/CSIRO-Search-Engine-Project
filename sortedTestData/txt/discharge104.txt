REASON FOR ADMISSION :
**NAME[BBB AAA] is an **AGE[in 80s]- year - old female who presented to Northwest with some episodes of confusion .
**INSTITUTION was notified of her presence last week and the patient was set up for a biopsy but , due to her being on aspirin and Plavix , this was put off for seven days .
In the interim , the patient was discharged to home and had worsening episodes of confusion and left - sided weakness for which she was readmitted to **INSTITUTION .
At that time , her previously noted right posterior splenial lesion was noted to have intralesional hemorrhage .
At this point , she was urgently transported down to **INSTITUTION for further evaluation .
CT scan at this point showed a stable area of blood .
The patient was able to be transferred out of the ICU without difficulty .
She underwent MR - guided stereotactic biopsy on **DATE[May 16 2007] without difficulty .
The preliminary pathology at this time was GBM .
On **DATE[May 18 2007] , we expect she will be transferred back to Northwest for skilled nursing facility / TCU care .
