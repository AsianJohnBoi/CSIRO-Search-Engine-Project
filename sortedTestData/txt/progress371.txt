ADMISSION DATE :
**DATE[Apr 12 2007]
EVALUATION DATE :
**DATE[Apr 14 07]
I personally interviewed and examined the patient this morning and discussed the case with Dr. **NAME[XXX] .
I agree with the findings , impression , and plans as indicated in his notes .
Overnight , the patient 's IV pain medicines were readjusted .
It turned out that the conversion amount from her oral to her IV dose was not quite equivalent , and she is now on an equivalent dose and feels much better .
She did complain of back pain and neck pain throughout the evening and also increased burning pain in her midepigastrium which is consistent with reflux .
She has no other significant complaints , and now that the medication is more well dosed , she feels better .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
Blood pressure 136/77 , pulse is in the 70s .
She is afebrile .
Her lungs show poor inspiratory effort .
Her abdominal exam is again variable .
She complains bitterly of pain with light palpation , however does not complain of pain with rather deep palpation but with a stethoscope .
Extremities reveal no edema .
LABORATORY DATA :
Her laboratories are unremarkable .
Electrolytes , BUN , and creatinine are normal .
White blood cell count is 7600 and hemoglobin and hematocrit are 10.8 and 31.3 .
IMPRESSION :
Abdominal pain .
The abdominal pain is almost assuredly chronic .
There was some evidence by CT scan of a pancolitis ; however , her exam , white count , and progress are not consistent with that .
We will therefore advance her diet from clears to soft solids to full diet as tolerated and move to covert her IV pain medicines to oral pain medicines as she improves .
