**INSTITUTION :
This remarkable **AGE[90+]- year-old widow , who lives with her niece and son-in-law on a farm , had a syncopal episode .
She does not remember going down .
She sustained a left lower spiral tibial fracture and a fibular fracture .
She was brought to the emergency room .
Her past medical history is significant for triple-vessel disease in the coronaries evaluated in the past by Dr. **NAME[WWW] .
The patient is no candidate for [_______________]*** procedure and she has also had a bitemporal severe arteritis approximately 4 years ago that responded slow taper of steroids .
I have not seen her for several months , but she has continued to receive 10 mg of prednisone on a daily basis without incident .
She has had a CVA in the past with diplopia , but no recurrence .
She has had a right mastectomy for many many years ago without any recurrence and suffers from osteoporosis .
Her blood pressure was stable .
On exam she was 130/80 and a pulse of 76 with rare ectopics .
There was some mild skin ecchymosis in the upper extremities .
There was some flat skin lesions over the scalp .
The patient was alert and had a fairly good memory .
The heart was significant for a grade 2 to 3 over 6 systolic murmur at the base that radiated into the neck and into the left as well as the right carotid areas .
The lungs were clear .
The patient was in a wheelchair .
The extremities showed a left leg cast just below the knee .
Her current medications when she came in was
1. Norvasc .
2. Plavix .
3. Prednisone .
4. Metoprolol .
The patient was seen by cardiology as well as by orthopedics .
The patient received some physical therapy , but continued to have problems with significant pain .
Relief of pain was difficult and ultimately required OxyContin Extended Release .
This was at first 10 mg twice a day then increased to 20 b.i.d. and finally 30 mg twice a day .
She had a problem with constipation and urinary retention , but this was relieved by disimpaction and with a soapsuds enema .
Her last set of chemistries looked fairly stable .
She did show some very mild iron deficiency with 10% saturation and her B12 level was also low when she was seen .
Orthopedics followed her and felt that nonweightbearing for 6 to 8 weeks with a walker and then functional brace and will take approximately 3 months to heal and then of course the patient will need to be followed up by Dr. **NAME[XXX] at all .
The TIBC was 277 and her iron saturation at 10% .
Her TSH was upper limits of normal at 4.92 .
A B12 level was 190 and a folic acid was normal at 6.7 .
Other studies appeared quite good .
She was seen in consultation by Dr. **NAME[VVV] who felt the patient was reasonably stable at this point ; however , she did evolve with some chest pain 24 hours prior to discharge and had a slight elevation of the troponin consistent with probably a remote myocardial infarction .
The patient was discharged definitely improved for rehab at Vincentian Regency under the care of Dr. **NAME[UUU] .
It is conceivably possible that the patient begins to ambulate and she may return home with her niece and son-in-law .
