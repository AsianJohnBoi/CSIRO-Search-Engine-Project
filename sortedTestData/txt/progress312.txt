I have been requested by Dr.**NAME[ZZZ] to take care of this patient admitted to the ICU .
I am managing this patient 's respiratory failure , hypotension , malnutrition , hyperglycemia and infectious disease .
I have examined this patient , reviewed the data in the medical records , looked at the most recent x-ray films .
This patient 's care has been provided under my direct supervision .
On my examination this morning the patient is awake , alert , oriented , warm , well - perfused .
Examination of the heart reveals S1 , S2 present .
Normal sinus rhythm .
Lungs reveal diminished breath sounds at both bases .
Abdomen is softer and nontender .
With regards to my assessment and plan :
The patient 's respiratory failure - she tolerated trach - mask only for a short time today .
Subsequently had to be placed on the ventilator .
Her airway pressures are okay .
Her x-ray looks within acceptable limits at the present time .
Her air leaks are minimal .
There is no pneumothorax .
She has been having episodes of hypotension requiring fluid boluses at the present time .
She responded to two fluid boluses of 250 mL of Hextend .
Her mixed - venous oxygen saturation essentially is 68 .
Her lactate is normal .
I hence think she is more vasodilated than anything else .
I have changed her central line and placed a new PICC line .
All of her cultures are negative .
I have continued Unasyn .
The patient was on 10 mg of prednisone at home .
Here , she is only on 7.5 mg p.o.
This to rule out ________ insufficiency .
I have initiated this patient on stress dose steroids .
With regards to the patient 's belly , the patient 's belly seems to be slightly distended and soft .
She has got good bowel sounds at the present time .
She has been complaining of some nausea .
I have hence decreased her tube feed volume by half and initiated some Reglan on a continuous basis .
I have continued this patient 's insulin infusion for tight glycemic control and continued her stress ulcer prophylaxis .
I have also sent off two blood cultures on this patient today and placed a new arterial line for better hemodynamic monitoring .
I have continued this patient 's stress ulcer prophylaxis .
Total critical care time I have provided on this patient today is 37 minutes .
