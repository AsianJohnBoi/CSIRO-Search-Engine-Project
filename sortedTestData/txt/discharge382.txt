HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
This is an **AGE[in 80s]- year - old female with the above-stated past medical history who has struggled with glucose control , renal function in the recent past .
The patient presented with increased weigh gain and shortness of breath on exertion .
She was found to be in congestive heart failure upon presentation with a BNP of 939 .
BUN and creatinine were close to baseline at 55 and 1.6 respectively .
Digoxin level was noted to be elevated at 2.2 .
EKG showed a paced rhythm .
Troponin was negative .
H and H were low at 10.5 and 32.6 respectively but these are chronic .
The patient was admitted for diuresis and adjustment of medications .
Her digoxin was held for 5 days and then restarted at 0.125 mg p.o. every other day .
The patient 's BUN and creatinine remained relatively stable peaking at 67 and 1.8 respectively .
The patient 's Glucovance was discontinued due to risk of lactic acidosis from the elevated creatinine .
The patient was maintained on insulin 70/30 in the morning and a sliding scale .
The 70/30 dose was titrated up to 24 units q.a.m. at the time of discharge .
It was decided to add an evening dose of regular insulin on a standing basis due to the patient 's hypoglycemia , which occurs anytime she goes on long - acting insulin in the evening or when she goes on Lantus .
The patient had a recent wrist injury , which remained stable throughout the admission .
Her feet did relatively well .
Her large lower extremity edema remained about the same .
The patient diuresed several liters of fluid while in the hospital .
The legs do considerably better when they are elevated .
The patient has tophi from gout .
Her uric acid level was checked and it was 10.9 .
Her allopurinol was therefore increased from 100 mg p.o. daily to 200 mg p.o. daily .
It was not felt safe to increase the allopurinol any further because of the patient 's renal function .
The patient 's Lasix was changed to Bumex at the onset of the admission .
Her Zaroxolyn was increased from 2.5 to 5 mg p.o. daily .
The patient 's Bumex was titrated down to 4 mg p.o. b.i.d. several days into the admission and then 4 mg p.o. daily .
The patient did put out approximately 1 liter more than she put in while on the 4 mg of Bumex daily p.o.
Cardiology concurred with the recommended therapy .
Echocardiogram was obtained and revealed worsened aortic stenosis .
The aortic stenosis is now considered to be moderately severe with a maximum grading of 38 mmHg and a mean gradient of 24 mmHg and an estimated aortic valve area of 0.9 sq. cm .
The patient had moderate tricuspid insufficiency with a pulmonary artery pressure of 50 mmHg .
She had moderate left atrial enlargement and concentric left ventricular hypertrophy with an EF of 40% .
The patient 's mental status remained about the same throughout the admission .
The patient had some dementia but is able to carry a conversation .
She lives with her daughter who works at a pharmacy .
Home care was consulted .
