I am continuing to see this **AGE[in 70s]- year - old gentleman status post CABG , postop course complicated with cardiac arrest and now with severe anoxic encephalopathy with burst suppression on EEG yesterday .
Hemodynamically he remains unchanged index ___________ 2.5 .
He continues on 5 mcg of dopamine as well as epinephrine at 0.1 .
Also he became a little bit vasodilated overnight and ended up back on the Vasopressin at 0.02 units per minute .
The balloon pump remains in ___________ at 1:1 .
From a respiratory standpoint the AA gradient remains stable .
The patient , also of note , with elevated LFT s secondary to a shocked liver .
Neurologically patient still with mono clonus worse than yesterday clinically .
I am continuing him on propofol for suppression of this activity in light that his jerking notably makes the family uncomfortable .
I did have another discussion with the patient 's family .
I did again inform them that he appears to be having more mono clonus activity , has not shown any recovery , and his prognosis remains extremely poor as far as neurological recovery .
I did speak to them again about what their wishes would be in light of note that he is unlikely to recover .
They again did express to me that he would not want to live like this .
They did want to proceed ahead , as per their wishes , to get an EEG in the morning , and if he still has burst suppression on the EEG , at that point in time they did want to make him comfortable .
But of note , his birthday is apparently tomorrow , so their wish is not to withdraw support on Friday , but likely wait until Saturday .
I told them whatever made them comfortable as far as getting through this process would be acceptable to me .
I did discuss with them that if his heart should stop or he should have a lethal arrhythmia , that we should not do any chest compressions or any defibrillation on him , and his wife was in agreement to this .
Otherwise she did want to continue current management and clinical care .
So , at this point in time , we will proceed ahead , get the EEG tomorrow , and otherwise continue his current supportive care and management .
