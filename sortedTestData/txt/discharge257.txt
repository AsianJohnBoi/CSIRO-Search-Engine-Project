Mrs. **NAME[BBB M. AAA] is a **AGE[in 60s]- year - old who arrives by STAT Medivac Triage from the intensive care unit at the **INSTITUTION in the setting of hypotension , atrial flutter and concern regarding acute ischemic syndrome .
Mrs. **NAME[AAA] carries a background history of atrial dysrhythmias .
She has required cardioversion in the past in a setting of what appears to have been atrial flutter .
She underwent a stress test on **DATE[May 7 2005] and at that time was found to have small - two - moderate scarring in the proximal - to - mid inferior periinfarct ischemia .
Still , the ejection fraction was 65% .
She was currently admitted to the **INSTITUTION in the context of hypokalemia , apparent volume contraction , and weakness .
During the hospital stay , she was talking on the telephone and may well have aspirated .
The patient was found in her room slumped down with the phone off the hook .
An atrial dysrhythmia was evident .
The initial thought was that the patient had an acute ischemic syndrome and was intubated .
She was subsequently referred here .
Sinus rhythm was reestablished and there were no hyperacute changes .
Troponin was only modestly positive .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
The patient carries a history of recurrent SVT .
She has apparently been cardioverted in the past in that context .
The patient carries a history of schizo - affective disorder .
She carries a history of cholecystectomy .
She underwent hip repair for a fracture .
She carries a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease .
HABITS AND ADDICTIONS :
The patient is an active and committed tobacco addict .
ALLERGIES :
The patient carries a history of allergic reaction to SULFA and MOLD .
HOME MEDICATIONS :
1. Aspirin 81 mg p.o. q.am.
2. Ativan 0.5 mg p.o. daily .
3. Prozac 30 mg p.o. q.bedtime .
4. Toprol XL 50 mg p.o. q.day .
5. Synthroid 0.1 mg p.o. q.day .
6. Depakote 250 mg p.o. b.i.d. and 500 mg in the evening .
7. Prilosec .
8. Singulair 10 mg p.o. q.day .
9. Haldol 7 mg p.o. q.day .
10. Celebrex .
11. Vicodin 5/500 mg p.o. q.pm.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
On exam , the patient is intubated and sedated .
Her heart rate is in the 110 range and the rhythm appears to be atrial flutter with variable conduction .
There are crepitant rales at both bases .
There is scattered rhonchi more on the right than on the left .
The apical impulse is discrete , tapping and nonsustained .
The patient has normal first and a physiological good second heart sound .
There is a hyperdynamic outflow tract murmur .
Neck veins are flat .
There are no carotid bruits .
The lower extremities are warm to the touch .
IMPRESSION AND PLAN :
Problem #1 :
Atrial flutter .
The patient has been systemically anticoagulated and is now on amiodarone .
We will back off on the pressors ( beginning with alpha - agonists ) in an effort to enhance the likelihood of medical conversion to sinus rhythm .
The chest film demonstrates haziness in the right base and we need to watch over the next few days that she does not develop a frank infiltrate in that territory .
Even ARDS here is of concern .
On the other hand , it would appear that she might well be a candidate for extubation over the upcoming days .
The patient will need a transthoracic echocardiogram interrogation .
The likelihood is that left ventricular functions are normal .
The patient will ultimately need some form of risk stratification but that is a bit of a down the road consideration .
Today , heart goals will be to :
A. Diminish the pressor therapy .
B. Volume replete .
C. Ask the renal service of Dr. **NAME[XXX] to see regarding the interesting occurrence , here , of metabolic acidosis and assistance in excluding R renin , T tubular , A acidosis .
There is also the provocative thought , here , of Conn 's syndrome in the setting of the earnest hypokalemia evident .
