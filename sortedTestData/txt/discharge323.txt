This patient had had a history of worsening low back pain , and the pain radiating down into his lower extremities .
Despite conservative therapy symptoms did not improve .
Neuro - imaging studies revealed evidence of lumbar stenosis as well as a right L5-S1 hernial nucleus pulposus .
After review of the studies and physical examination , it was our recommendation that the patient undergo surgical intervention .
After a lengthy explanation of risk versus benefits , the patient agreed to all surgeries .

Postoperatively , the incision line was clean , dry , and flat closed superficially with staples .
He had a drain placed , which was removed postoperative day 2. He had considerable __________ discomfort and was slow to move initially , but he is gradually increasing his activity .
He also had some complaints of left shin pain , which he said he had bumped on the Saturday prior to his admission , but this discomfort was gradually improving .
He was seen by P M and R , and it was their feeling that the patient might benefit from in - house rehabilitation stay ; however , the patient was fairly adamant in his wish to go home .
As a result , he will be going home with home PT and OT arrangements .
He was given the appropriate instruction in regard to activity as well as management of incision line .
