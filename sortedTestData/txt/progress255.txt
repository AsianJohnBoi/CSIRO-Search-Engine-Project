I am seeing this critically ill man for management of volume overload , cardiomyopathy , and hyperglycemia .
I have examined the patient , the laboratory data , chest x-ray film and events of evening .
From a respiratory standpoint , he has got a small right effusion .
His A-a gradient has got quite reasonable ; however , he has good mechanics .
I will begin him on Lasix 40 mg IV b.i.d.
He was positive four liters overall .
We have been able to come off the epinephrine and still on milrinone and for inotropic support .
I will drop him down to 0.3 mcg / kg / min .
Ultimately , I think he will benefit from afterload reduction but his mean blood pressure is still only marginal and I would hold off on starting back yet .
His BUN is 29 , creatinine 1.2 , continues to improve .
Platelet count is 72,000 , no evidence of bleeding .
He has been on insulin infusion which I would discontinue and followup by sliding scale , continue on milrinone support at this point .
T = 30 .
