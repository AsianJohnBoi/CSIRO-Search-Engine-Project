HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is doing okay today .
No new complaints .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
We rolled her over to look at her decubitus ulcer .
She has a very deep decub that has good granulation tissue .
It is approximately 6 x 10 cm long .
It is regularly shaped .
There is no dead tissue deep into the wound , and it looks like it goes down close to her sacrum .
We did gynecology exam on her today .
Her examination , because we took her down to do gynecologic exam today , took over an hour of time .
We got her into the stirrup .
She was having a lot of bleeding .
Probably , she is having her period at this point .
Around her urethra , she has a polypoid - looking lesion .
It did not appear particularly friable at this time right at the urethral entrance consistent with a probable urethral polyp .
Her vaginal vault had bloody drainage , so the wet prep was negative .
There were no open lesions that seemed to be communicating to the anterior pelvis .
There is no evidence of fistula .
No purulent drainage noted .
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN :
1. Probable recurrent osteomyelitis .
We are awaiting her bone scan results .
They are not yet available and Nuclear Medicine was unavailable today .
I talked with Surgery about her , and they recommended getting a repeat CT scan so they can help prepare her for surgery .
She is off antibiotics at this point .
We will continue wound care for sacral decubitus .
2. As far her vaginal discharge is concerned , she is now having her period , and it is hard to interpret wet prep results .
If she has continued problems after she has completed this period , we told her that she needs to follow up with **INSTITUTION to have them do her regular Pap smear which she is due for plus reevaluate her vaginal vault and discharge when she is not having active .
