Addendum
Mr. **NAME[AAA] is status post heart catheterization and percutaneous coronary intervention of his saphenous vein graft to the obtuse marginal branch .
This was done by Dr. **NAME[ZZZ] on **DATE[Feb 10 2007] .
He was observed overnight and was stable for discharge the morning of **DATE[Feb 11 2007] .
He was getting ready for discharge when he desaturated into the 70s on room air .
He was immediately put on 5 L of oxygen , and his saturations came up to the 90s .
His discharge was cancelled .
Dr. **NAME[WWW VVV] from pulmonary service was consulted , and the patient was put on a higher dose of Lasix 20 mg daily .
The patient was seen by Dr. **NAME[UUU TTT] .
A V/Q scan was done which was read as intermediate probability for pulmonary emboli ; however , it was decided by Dr. **NAME[ZZZ] and Dr. **NAME[TTT] that the likelihood of the suspicion of PE was not very high .
Therefore , IV heparin was not initiated .
He also had lower extremity Dopplers which were negative for any DVT .
A high - resolution CT imaging of the chest confirms the presence of interstitial lung disease with a characteristic UIP pattern likely representing IPF .
There is extensive interstitial lung disease with pulmonary fibrosis , honeycombing , and traction bronchio - atelectasis in a predominantly subpleural and peripheral distribution with greatest involvement in the lower lobes .
There were no CT findings to indicate active alveolitis .
It showed cardiac enlargement with multiple small lymph nodes none of which were abnormally enlarged , often present with IPF .
There was no evidence of pulmonary nodule or mass .
The patient was also ordered pulmonary function studies ; however , they were not done .
These can be done as an outpatient in the next week or two .
He will need to have his PA pressures reassessed in about 4 weeks .
As per Dr. **NAME[TTT] 's note , the first goal is to treat the hypoxia .
Home O2 has been ordered and arranged .
The patient 's Combivent inhalers are going to be discontinued .
He is going to start on Spiriva once a day .
His amiodarone was also discontinued by Dr. **NAME[TTT] with a likelihood of long - term toxicity .
Again , the patient is stable for discharge this evening .
He is to have BUN and CBC with platelets drawn next week .
If those are within normal limits , we will schedule him for a repeat heart catheterization and stenting of his right coronary artery at the end of next week or two .
He has to get pulmonary function studies done as an outpatient , continue on the list of medications that will be given at the end of the dictation , and then followup with Dr. **NAME[UUU TTT] with pulmonary after his repeat heart catheterization .
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS :
Now have been adjusted .
1. Tylenol 650 mg p.r.n.
