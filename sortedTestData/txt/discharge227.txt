HISTORY :
Mr. **NAME[AAA] is an **AGE[in 80s]- year - old white male , Lebanese immigrant who was admitted recently with respiratory failure , CO2 narcosis , and bladder outlet obstruction .
He was sent home with a Foley catheter in anticipation of surgery as an outpatient .
However , the patient pulled his Foley catheter a few times at home at periods of confusion causing hematuria .
He visited the emergency room few times , but the last one , he had malfunction of his Foley catheter and obstruction and had to be admitted for further evaluation .
Please refer to history and physical on the chart .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted , and his Foley catheter was changed by urology .
We did urine cultures and blood cultures on him on admission , which came back positive and finally showed enterococcus .
The patient was put on IV vancomycin in addition to Avelox , which was used for bronchitis and urine infection .
The patient 's general condition seemed to improve with that .
His leukocytosis , his fever , his weakness , and all the general conditions seemed to get better .
He was stabilized in other aspects .
His pulmonary status tried to be optimized with inhalers and nebulized therapy .
Finally , we tried to have him ready for surgery .
On the day where TURP was planned by Dr. **NAME[WWW] , the patient developed leukocytosis with a white count up to 17,000 .
His UA came back positive consistent with the infection .
It seemed that he probably had urinary infection with gram - negative bacteria .
He was put on Cipro to continue 10 days on that .
We do not feel comfortable with him going to any kind of prostate surgery at this time with his urine infection .
He was to continue Cipro , full course , and come back for laser TURP as an outpatient .
Pulmonarywise , he is stable .
His pCO2 came back about 50 .
He has anemia that improved significantly with Procrit and p.o. iron .
Prior to discharge , he had venous Dopplers of both lower extremities , which was negative .
His appetite was improving .
His bowel movements were good .
His pulmonary status is very stable .
LABORATORIES :
Prior to discharge; his sodium 140 , potassium 4.5 , CO2 of 29 , BUN 18 , and creatinine 1.2 .
His WBC is 16.3 , part of that could be related to intensive Procrit therapy .
Hemoglobin is 13.2 , hematocrit 40.6 , and platelet count 352 , it was up to 399 .
PT and PTT are normal .
Repeat blood cultures were negative .
Repeat chest x-ray revealed very small bilateral effusion .
**INSTITUTION in stable condition .
Continue home care .
We will order hospital bed for him at home , re-activate home care , and check labs in about 7 days prior to his surgery .
