VENTILATOR MANAGEMENT NOTE:
I am managing this **AGE[in 60s]- year - old female with respiratory failure and renal failure after sternectomy for mediastinal __________ .
Chest x-ray today shows stable bilateral effusions .
I have rested her overnight on assist control .
The tidal volume is 500 .
Her peak airway pressures are 26 .
The gas exchange has remained stable at 40% FIO2 .
Today , I have weaned her PEEP down to 5 and have her out of bed into a chair , and we are doing pressure support trials , pressure support between 10-12 .
She has tolerated that reasonably well for a couple of hours .
We plan to rest her back on assist control .
She has been able to go only an hour or two each day .
In terms of her ischemic heart disease , her rate control is adequate now on carvedilol that I started her on yesterday with no signs of hypotension .
In fact , she still remains somewhat hypertensive with mean arterial pressures between 90 and 110 with a heart rate in the 60s to 70s .
I started her on a low dose ACE - inhibitor for better blood pressure control .
She is finishing up a course of cefepime and vancomycin for mediastinitis and has clinically been improving .
