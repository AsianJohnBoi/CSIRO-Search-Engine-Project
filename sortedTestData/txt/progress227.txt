**DATE[Apr 20 07]
I am seeing this patient this morning because of chronic respiratory failure and renal failure .
This patient has been in the ICU for more than six weeks after severe mediastinitis and wound failure after chronic bypass .
The patient has slowly improved .
She went to the operating room yesterday for an open GJ tube .
This morning her temperature max was 37.2 .
She had one slight episode of hypotension that responded to fluid after surgery .
She is alert , awake , following commands somewhat , anxious and agitated when she is asked to be weaned .
Her creatinine has gone up to 1.7 .
We will follow this closely , and increase her IV fluids .
This might be related to the surgery yesterday .
Her white count is 21 and unchanged .
Hemoglobin is 8.5 .
Hematocrit is 25.6 .
We hold the Ativan for the time being .
She will receive 500 cubic centimeters of Hextend this morning , and she will be started back on heparin .
The patient is now on no antibiotics .
There is no evidence of active infection at the present time , and we are awaiting for her to go to a chronic ___________________ facility , hopefully will happen in the next week , when she is back to her total needs and tube feeds , and we will wean the ventilator appropriately .
I , Dr. **NAME[XXX] , was present for the entire assessment .
Code 99233 .
