HOSPITAL COURSE :
Mrs. **NAME[AAA] is an **AGE[in 80s]- year - old female with history of peripheral vascular disease , history of atrial fibrillation , history of chronic back pain , and a compression fracture , who presented on the **DATE[Feb 16 2007] , after being brought in when she had lethargy and a fall at home and was noted to have an elevated troponin in ED and was admitted to ICU for further management .
The patient was initially going to be managed medically for her non - Q-wave myocardial infarction but subsequently developed chest pain and was taken to the catheterization laboratory .
She had a stent placed to her LAD and had a stable post stent course .
She was transferred out of the CCU to the floor and worked with Cardiopulmonary Rehabilitation .
The patient did have some deconditioning and lack of activity , so it was felt that she would be appropriate for rehabilitation placement after discharge .
Of note , while in ICU , the patient had an episode of headache and some facial droop which was evaluated by Neurology , but the facial droop resolved , and Neurology did not feel there was any evidence of an acute CVA .
There was a question of NPH on an MRI , and Neurology recommended that the patient needed reconditioning and then evaluate gait to determine if further testing is needed .
The patient was admitted on Coumadin for her history of atrial fibrillation .
She was in a regular rate at admission and after being transferred to the floor remained in a regular rate .
Given this and also her fall risk , it is felt that she is no longer a candidate for Coumadin , so we will hold it .
The patient was discovered to be anemic in ICU and was started on iron per the ICU staff .
She received a brief course of antibiotics for UTI .
She was continued on Pulmicort , Xopenex , and Singulair for her COPD .
These should be weaned as appropriate at the rehabilitation place .
The patient 's compression fracture in her back caused some pain , and she improved on OxyContin and was offered p.r.n. Percocet as she needed it .
The patient is discharged to the rehabilitation place in stable condition and should work with the therapist to work on her physical therapy .
She should follow up with Dr. **NAME[ZZZ] within 1 to 2 weeks and will be given specific instructions as to when to follow up with Cardiology and Neurology .
