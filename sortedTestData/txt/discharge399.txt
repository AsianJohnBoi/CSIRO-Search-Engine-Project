HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted because of the reoccurrence of diarrhea due to Clostridium difficile infection .
It was the third reoccurrence , so the patient was started on vancomycin after discussion with Dr. **NAME[SSS] for chronic Clostridium difficile .
The patient was consulted by Dr. **NAME[UUU TTT] for chronic kidney disease as GFR was 46 and chronic anemia with hemoglobin of 8.9 and hematocrit of 27.4 .
The patient was advised a panel of tests including bone scan which showed increased uptake at the midshaft of the right femur .
UPEP and SPEP were ordered by Dr. **NAME[TTT] , but the results still awaited .
The patient has significant proteinuria with urine positive for protein .

According to Dr. **NAME[TTT] , the patient has to stay back because she might have a possibility of multiple myeloma due to chronic anemia , increased uptake in the bone scan , and significant proteinuria in the urine .
He has ordered UPEP and SPEP .
We were waiting for Dr. **NAME[SSS] to call regarding the vancomycin dosage for chronic Clostridium difficile , and the discharge summary was done before Dr. **NAME[SSS] could call , so I did not write the vancomycin dosage .
We informed the patient at home to call Dr. **NAME[VVV] 's office tomorrow in the morning , earliest possible to get the vancomycin dosage , and the patient will be called back for her SPEP and UPEP results to rule out multiple myeloma .
This has been told to Dr. **NAME[PPP OOO] who will discuss with Dr. **NAME[VVV] in a.m.
