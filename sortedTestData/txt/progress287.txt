I personally manage Ms. **NAME[AAA] in the ICU .
She is a **AGE[in 40s]- year - old woman with a history of encephalitis , probably viral .
Her overall condition has improved somewhat today .
Her mental status is somewhat improved .
She is communicating with her family and is oriented times one .
This seems to be an improvement from yesterday .
A chest x-ray also shows a marginal improving trend and I suspect that she might be getting better because of antivirals .
She is on Duo feeding tubes as of today .
We can try to start feeding her , if possible , when her mental status starts settling down some more .
She continues to be somewhat agitated but she seems to be somewhat better today on Seroquel .
She passes air reasonably well on both sides of her chest .
Heart is regular rhythm .
Abdomen is soft .
She continues on dialysis which she tolerates well .
Her laboratory parameters are otherwise unremarkable .
Her overall condition has not changed significant , except for improvement in her mental status .
CRITICAL CARE TIME : 30 MINUTES .
