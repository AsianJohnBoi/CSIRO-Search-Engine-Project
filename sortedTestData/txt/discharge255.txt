REASON FOR ADMISSION :
The patient was admitted because of cough .
She fell approximately 1 month ago with a fractured right hip and spent time in the rehabilitation and discharged 2 weeks ago and was doing well .
Because of increased cough , she came to the hospital .
She denied any chest pain .
Her weight count was elevated at 33,000 .
Chest x-ray was consistent with pneumonia .
Blood cultures were drawn , and the patient was started on IV Avelox .
Past history includes hypertension , bradycardia , hyperlipidemia , depression , and osteoarthritis .
She denies any alcohol and tobacco products .
On arrival , BUN was also elevated at 52 and creatinine 1.1 .
Troponin level was 0.09 .
LABORATORY DATA :
Urinalysis 6 to 10 wbc 's , above 40 squamous cells , rare bacteria , sodium 135 , potassium 2.7 , which was repleted intravenously .
BUN and creatinine were 44 and 1.2 .
Hemoglobin and hematocrit 11.5 and 33.7 , white count 43,100 .
At discharge , BUN and creatinine 28 and 0.7 , TSH 2.21 , white count on discharge 19,800 .
Stools were positive for C. difficile colitis .
The patient also had a positive yeast urinary tract infection .
Blood cultures showed no growth .
T4 1.2 .
Free T3 192 .
As outlined above , the patient was admitted with pneumonia .
She was started on Avelox .
Respiratory treatments were given .
O2 saturations were followed and kept at 92% .
Initially , a consult was requested to Dr. **NAME[VVV] La **NAME[UUU] because of pneumonia .
She also had a leukocytosis .
Dr. **NAME[VVV] La **NAME[UUU] suspected that this focus may be intraabdominal , and he did suspect C. difficile colitis .
Stool studies were done and were positive .
He did add Flagyl to her regimen , discontinued Avelox in favor of cefepime , and in addition to Flagyl , Diflucan was also added because of urinary tract infection consisting of yeast .
Vancomycin was added to Flagyl for C. difficile colitis , and isolation was implemented as well .
Because of her leukocytosis , a hematological evaluation was requested to Dr. **NAME[TTT] .
He suspected that the spike in her white count from her last admission of 12000 was secondary to a leukemoid reaction due to pneumonia .
He continued to follow her and leukocytosis did improve at discharge .
He was also found to be anemic .
Thyroid function studies were also done in addition to a CAT scan , which showed evidence of nodular goiter with low thyroid function studies .
For this reason , Dr. **NAME[SSS] from Endocrine was asked to see the patient for multinodular goiter , and the patient would require outpatient workup .
Currently , she was euthyroid , and he felt this was probably result of her acute and chronic illness .
Further workup will be done including repeat thyroid function studies as an outpatient .
At the time of discharge , the patient was free of any chest pain , shortness of breath , and had no diarrhea .
Physical therapy had been initiated , and it was felt that she would require supervision and skilled nursing facility to monitor her laboratory data as well .
Her white count was down to 19,800 .
BUN and creatinine were down to 28 and 0.7 but will continue to be monitored closely .
From standpoint of pneumonia , it was felt that the patient was stable , and followup chest x-ray will be done till complete resolution of pneumonia .
From standpoint of C. difficile colitis , she will still require isolation until stools are negative x 3 .
She will have a thyroid workup as an outpatient and will follow with Dr. **NAME[SSS] .
She was discharged to a skilled nursing facility .
She will follow a healthy - heart diet .
She does need assistance with meals , and she will continue with physical therapy .
If she has any chest pain , shortness of breath , increasing diarrhea , or fever , Dr. **NAME[ZZZ] is to be notified .
