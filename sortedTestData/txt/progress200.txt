I am managing this critically ill **AGE[in 60s]- year - old female , status post sternal debridement for sternitis after CABG surgery .
The hospital course was complicated by respiratory failure and renal insufficiency .
I am seeing her for management of these issues .
I have seen and examined the patient , reviewed her laboratory , radiographic and EMTEK data and discussed the management with the Critical Care House
Staff .
The problems and management are as follows :
1. Sternitis :
She is going back to the operating room for repeat debridement with possible closure .
Of note , her white blood cell count is up to 30,000 today .
She is being covered for her Pseudomonas infection with Cefepime and shows good in vitro coverage of the current Pseudomonas .
However , my plan will be to re - evaluate the antibiotic coverage after she comes back from the operating room , with the thought that if there is a significant amount of purulence still within the wound , that we will add a second agent , most likely ciprofloxacin for double coverage of the Pseudomonas in light of her increasing leukocytosis .
I have investigated other causes of her leukocytosis as well , including ordering repeat blood cultures times two , as well as urinalysis , urine culture , Clostridium difficile toxins and starting her empirically on Flagyl in light of some liquid diarrhea .
2. Renal insufficiency :
BUN is up to 30 today , her creatinine is stable at 1.2 .
The urine output has been 1.3 liters , but we will need to watch closely .
I have a feeling that she is drifting into some renal insufficiency .
3. Respiratory failure :
The chest x-ray shows some decrease in the bilateral effusions .
I have rested her on a pressure support of 20 and this is giving her a reasonable spontaneous tidal volume with about 600 mL or so with a minute ventilation of around 8 liters , but no plans for any ventilatory changes today in light of her trip to the operating room .
4. ICU Prophylaxis :
She has stress ulcer and DVT prophylaxis .
Her tube feeds are off and she is going to the operating room and I have increased her beta blockade slightly for better heart rate and blood pressure control in light of her ischemic heart disease .
TOTAL CRITICAL CARE TIME EQUALS 40 MINUTES .
