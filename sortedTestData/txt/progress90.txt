NASHAR
ADMISSION DATE :
**DATE[Feb 18 2007]
EVALUATION DATE :
**DATE[Feb 19 07]
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
I have reviewed all the reports from the patient 's admission recently .
Basically , this is a **AGE[in 70s]- year - old veteran in the **INSTITUTION with no significant past cardiac history .
The last echocardiogram in 2003 showed an EF of 55% , with chronic renal insufficiency , hypertension , peripheral vascular disease , and history of stroke , who came into **INSTITUTION with 4 days of lightheadedness ; nausea ; poor appetite ; fatigue ; and two brief episodes of chest pain 4 days ago , left substernal , nonradiating , 5/10 , no associated symptoms , lasting for 2 minutes .
Denied any presyncopal episode .
Denied palpitations or shortness of breath .
Initially , went to the VA Emergency Department , and was found to be in a junctional rhythm and bradycardic .
The heart rate was in the 40s .
He was transferred to **INSTITUTION ED for further evaluation and was admitted to Pavilion Service for the treatment .
The patient was seen with Dr. **NAME[RRR] in the Pavilion Service and further treatment was undergone there and later on transferred to Medicine Service for further care and evaluation .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Hypertension , BPH , CRI , peripheral vascular disease , and history of CVA .
No history of CAD ; EF of 55% , but he smoked and quit 17 years back .
His EKG had showed sinus bradycardia alternating with junctional bradycardia .
MEDICATIONS :
He is on :
1. Atenolol .
2. Aspirin .
3. Felodipine .
4. Hydrochlorothiazide .
5. Zocor .
6. Allopurinol .
7. Terazosin .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
Vital Signs :
Stable .
His heart rate today was in the range of 70s after his beta blockers were stopped .
Blood pressure was 116/63 .
Nonhypoxic .
General :
Alert and oriented x3 .
No acute distress .
Lying comfortably .
HEENT :
Pupils were equal and reactive .
Lungs :
Some bibasilar crackles .
Cardiovascular :
Regular rate and rhythm .
No murmurs appreciated .
Extremities :
No edema .
IMPRESSION AND PLAN :
A **AGE[in 70s]- year - old with hypertension , CVA , peripheral vascular disease , and chronic renal insufficiency admitted with bradycardia and acute on chronic kidney injury .
1. Cardiovascular .
Bradycardia is resolved after beta blockers and calcium channel blockers were stopped and Norvasc was started .
Continue Norvasc for now .
Blood pressure not well controlled .
Again , it will be really a narrow choice of the medications we can use on him presently .
I think we can start some kind of other calcium channel blockers which would have less effect on the AV junction node , like verapamil ; it could be a different choice .
Diuretics will not be good .
Beta blockers really made him bradycardic and ACE inhibitors would not be a good one with his renal failure .
So , we have a pretty narrow choice here .
I am going to start him on a low - dose of verapamil tonight .
2. Acute on chronic renal injury .
Creatinine is down to 4.2 , was up to 5.2 when he came in with just IV fluids .
It looks like he has a prerenal cause of all this .
Continue IV fluids .
Check on renal ultrasound and follow up creatinine closely .
The patient looks like he had decreased p.o. intake .
Again , I do not know what his baseline creatinine is like .
He could have a baseline high and increased creatinine .
He was given bicarbonate by the previous service , will continue it .
I do not think he needs to be continued when he is discharged .
3. Peripheral vascular disease .
Continue cilostazol .
4. Now regarding his cardiac issues , he did not get a stress test .
Cardiology did not think that he needed one .
It can be done as an outpatient in the **INSTITUTION .
SOCIAL ISSUES :
He came from home .
I need to assess the home situation and see whether he can go home once his creatinine is coming down and is back to normal , or whether we will need some kind of placement like __________ or not .
Total time spent on this patient was 40 minutes in coordination of care and looking over his chart .
