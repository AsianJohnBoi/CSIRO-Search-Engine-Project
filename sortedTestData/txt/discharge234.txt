TRANSFERRED TO CARE OF :
DISPOSITION :
After discussion with the patient and her daughter , it was decided to transfer the patient to a skilled nursing facility .
TRANSFER DIAGNOSIS :
ABDOMINAL AORTIC ANEURYSM .
LABORATORY , RADIOGRAPHIC , AND OTHER DIAGNOSTIC STUDY FINDINGS :
The patient had the following study performed during this admission :
1. A CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis was performed on **DATE[Mar 13 2007] which showed no periaortic hematoma , but marked interval increase in the size of a large juxtarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm which was now 7.6 cm .
Severe emphysema and bibasilar fibrosis was seen , and diverticulosis and left lateral base diverticulum was also seen .
Also , it was commented that the rapid growth of the aneurysm was a significant finding in and of itself .
The previous size of the aneurysm was 5 x 4.7 cm .
Consults obtained :
1. Home oxygen evaluation consult .
2. Home care consult .
3. Physical Therapy consult was obtained .
**INSTITUTION COURSE :
The patient is an **AGE[in 80s]- year - old woman with a history of abdominal aortic aneurysm , which in **DATE[Sep 2005] was 5 x 4.7 cm in size , and a history of COPD , transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder , status post resection , enteral gastritis , previous hypothyroidism , history of hypercalcemia , a history of pulmonary embolism which she developed postoperatively , and osteoporosis , who presented with complaints of weakness , fatigue , decreased appetite , internally not feeling well for two weeks prior to admission .
She also had some lightheadedness .
She complained of chronic abdominal pain which was localized to the midline and lower part of the abdomen .
The patient denied any radiation of the pain , but this pain was associated with nausea and vomiting .
The patient also complained of constipation .
She denied fevers or chills .
She also stated that she had been feeling somewhat short of breath and had noticed increased sputum production .
The patient continues to smoke .
The patient denied headache , vision changes , palpitation , dysuria , or hematuria .
The patient does not use oxygen at home .
The patient denied hematochezia or melena .
She also complained of some dyspnea on exertion .
With regard to the patient 's abdominal pain , a CT scan of the abdomen was obtained which showed an enlarging aneurysm which was now about 7 cm .
This was thought to be contributing to her abdominal pain .
Also , she had chronic constipation , and she was placed on a bowel regimen , and with this , she had several bowel movements ; however , this did not improve her abdominal pain .
Also , during her hospital stay , the patient had an episode of hypotension .
On the morning of **DATE[Mar 13] , her pressures dropped down into the 70s and 60s systolic ; however , she maintained good mentation .
Also , the following morning , it was noted that her hemoglobin had dropped down from 13.9 to 10.9 .
Her hemoglobin thereafter stabilized .
The patient did not have any melena or blood per rectum .
There was no evidence of GI bleeding .
It was felt that patient might have had a leak from her AAA , which possibly had sealed off , and this would certainly explain her hypotension , abdominal pain , and drop in her hemoglobin .
However , the CT scan of the abdomen did not show any periaortic hematoma .
The patient 's constipation was treated with a bowel regimen consisting of Colace and Senna .
With this regimen , she had bowel movements .
She was also given a one - time dose of MiraLax which improved her constipation .
With regard to the patient 's pulmonary symptoms , she had noticed increased cough with increased sputum production .
Her chest x-ray did not show an infiltrate .
She was treated for a COPD exacerbation with DuoNebs and a five - day course of azithromycin which she completed on the day of discharge .
The patient also has a history of gastroesophageal reflux disease .
She was placed on Protonix .
She also has a history of hypothyroidism .
She was continued on her home dose of Synthroid , which is 88 mcg per day .
For prophylaxis , she received heparin subQ and SCD s .
For GI prophylaxis , she received Protonix .
TRANSFER INSTRUCTIONS :

NO KNOWN ALLERGIES .
2. Code Status :
The patient is DNR / DNI .
She did not wish to have any surgical interventions for her abdominal aortic aneurysm .
She also refused to have blood transfusions if needed .
