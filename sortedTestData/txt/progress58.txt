I was asked by Dr. **NAME[YYY ZZZ] 's to see this **AGE[in 50s]- year - old patient status post two-vessel coronary bypass grafting surgery .
I was asked to manage him for a hemodynamic / cardiovascular standpoint and also from a respiratory standpoint .
I examined , her reviewed her laboratory data and chest x-ray .
Hemodynamically the patient came out of the OR on phenylephrine which was weaned off shortly after she came out .
She subsequently became hypertensive requiring her to go on some nitroprusside .
Her initial cardiac index was 1.7 .
The patient reportedly had a stiff neck , noncompliant heart and off pump .
In light of this I did give her 500 cc of Hextend and her index improved to 2.5 .
Subsequent index was now down to 22 .
Blood pressure is reasonable , mean is still in the mid 60 s.
She is still on nitroprusside .
CVP is now down to 12 .
I did give her an additional 500 cc of Hextend for a total of 1 liter .
Crit initially when she came out was 27 , will probably repeat crit after this second 500 cc bolus .
Otherwise , she has been in normal sinus rhythm in the 70 s.
She is making good urine .
From a respiratory standpoint she initially came out with an increased A-a gradient with a pO2 of 103 .
She was recruited , dropped to 60% and subsequently has been weaned at 40% with improvement of her A-a gradient .
When she does awaken if she clinically continues to do well , we should be able to get her extubated .
She has had no postoperative bleeding .
She is on insulin drip 80:110 protocol for hyperglycemic control .
We will continue to titrate insulin accordingly .
Otherwise , I will continue her current supportive care and management .
Critical care time = 36 minutes .
