I am managing this **AGE[in 60s]- year - old female with a respiratory failure status post debridement of and sternal wound infection hospital course complicated by respiratory failure and renal insufficiency .
I am seeing her for management of these issues .
I have seen and examined the patient and reviewed her laboratory and radiographic and Emtek data and discussed the management with the plastic surgeons .
The problems and management are as follows :
1. Status post sternal wound debridement and pectoralis flap .
The patient is going back to the operating room for evacuation of hematoma seen on recent CT scan of the chest .
We have tapped her large pleural effusion .
Clinically it appears noninfected and it is clear straw colored fluid .
It was sent off the microbiology laboratory for evaluation and placed her on pigtail drainage to 20 cm water suction .
The white blood cell count still remains slightly elevated at 18,000 .
Although she has been afebrile , she remains on Cefepime day #18 of a 6 week course .
I have redosed her with Vancomycin today as well .
2. Renal failure I have placed her on pressure support today and she has been able to go for about 45 to 50 minutes before becoming tired and somewhat hypoxemic .
We have placed her on some recruitment maneuvers and increased her PEEP in light of her atelectasis and her hypoxemia and I will plan a weaning trial again tomorrow .
3. Renal insufficiency .
BUN creatinine are stable at 68 and 2.1 .
I have given her 2 doses of 40 mg of Lasix today and as soon as we are able to resume her tube feeds , I will discontinue her IV fluids .
4. ICU prophylaxis .
Currently she is n.p.o. going to the operating room for evacuation of her hematoma .
She has stress ulcer and DVT prophylaxis with subcutaneous Heparin and H2 blockers .
Total critical care time equals 40 minutes .
