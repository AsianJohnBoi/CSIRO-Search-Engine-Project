I am seeing this critically ill woman for management of respiratory insufficiency glycemic control , treatment of possible cholecystitis .
I have examined patient , laboratory data , chest x-ray films done this evening .
She has bilateral infiltrates , overall unchanged .
She has been off the ventilator overnight breathing with rates of 24 , still on 50% trach mask .
Hemodynamically , warm , well - perfused with good refill with mean blood pressures in the 70s .
I have her on insulin infusion for glycemic control with reasonable control at this point .
Her BUN is 19 , creatinine of 0.8 which is quite good .
Her white count is 12,000 , hematocrit is 25 .
Still has small air leaks but they have significantly improved .
Positive overall about 1300 cc yesterday .
She made 500 cc of urine but she is on track to do better than that today , making 400 cc so far today .
Still putting of her chest tube , so she has , I think it reasonable and sensible losses out of both ________ , although she may be a little bit dry , I think that we continue to run her that way to optimize her respiratory status , continue on Zosyn for question of cholecystitis , hydrocortisone down to 25 q. 6 .
Continue GI prophylaxis .
Lantus insulin at 10 q.a.m. but we will eventually transition her over to sliding scale .
From a nutritional standpoint , continue the Peptinex at 55 cc an hour which she is tolerating well .
A belly examination is benign .
Continue supportive care as above .
T = 32 .
