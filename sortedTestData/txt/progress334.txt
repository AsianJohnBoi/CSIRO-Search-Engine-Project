I am currently seeing this **AGE[in 50s]- year - old patient status post bilateral lung reduction surgery .
Postoperative course is complicated with respiratory failure , renal failure , volume overload , and electrolyte abnormalities .
I examined her , reviewed the laboratory data , chart data , and chest x-ray .
She hemodynamically was hemodynamically normal .
She has clinically been stable from this standpoint with sinus tach in the 100s to 119s .
Mean arterial pressure is running in the 60-80 mmHg range .
She is currently on no drips .
From a respiratory standpoint , she clinically is doing reasonably well .
Her A-a gradient remains stable .
She did a C-PAP weaning trial , pressure support of 5 , PEEP of 5 for six hours .
She saturated down to 83 and is now back on the ventilator .
Saturations are improved .
On 40% assist control , 5 of PEEP , her saturations are 96% .
She is in renal failure .
She had been on CVHDF , which I did discontinue today in light that it clotted off , and she has been hemodynamically stable and probably can be switched over to HD .
Her phosphate was 2.1 , being replaced with Neutra-Phos , but probably will need to stop it tomorrow .
Otherwise , she is on enteral nutritional support , which she has been tolerating .
She is currently on TwoCal HN at 30 cc an hour .
She is awake .
She is mentating __________ standpoint .
From an ID standpoint , she does continue on a course of vancomycin , which will stop after the dose today for left lower extremity cellulitis .
Otherwise , she hemodynamically remains stable from a renal electrolyte standpoint .
She has good volume with CVHDF , now clotted off .
Will try to convert her over to intermittent hemodialysis .
Otherwise will continue her ventilatory weaning , continue her current supportive care and management .
I did put her on heparin sub cu , held off on putting her back on IV heparin as she does have a history of lower extremity DVT in light that she still has some bloody secretions although not actively bleeding .
Hematocrit has been fairly stable .
Will keep an eye on this .
She is on GI prophylaxis .
Critical care time equal 32 minutes .
