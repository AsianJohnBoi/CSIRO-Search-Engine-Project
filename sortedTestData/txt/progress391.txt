I have been requested by Dr. **NAME[ZZZ] to take care of this patient admitted to the ICU .
He is a **AGE[in 50s]- year - old gentleman who is status post CABG times four .
His intraoperative was unremarkable .
His TEE showed good ejection fraction .
He has a slightly anterior airway requiring Bougie for intubation .
This morning on my examination , he was on 0.025 of epinephrine infusion with a cardiac index of more than 3 .
I have hence decided to wean the epinephrine off .
I initiated small dose p.o. Norvasc and weaned the IV Nitroglycerin off also .
I weaned him down to 40% FIO2 and 5 of PEEP .
His oxygenation and ventilation seem to be adequate .
He has increasing left - sided pleural effusion and had a drop in his hemoglobin today .
I hence repeated his x-ray and his hematocrit to rule out bleeding .
He does not have any further bleeding .
I have hence extubated him .
My plan is to start him on Lopressor , Lasix , and aspirin later this afternoon based on his pressures .
I have continued his insulin infusion for glycemic control .
His chest films ______ effusions , and I have continued his stress ulcer prophylaxis .
Total critical care time I have provided on this patient is **AGE[in 30s] minutes .
