I am managing this critically ill **AGE[in 60s]- year - old female who is status post sternal debridement for mediastinitis status post CABG surgery .
Her hospital course has been complicated by respiratory failure , acute renal failure and fluid overload .
I have seen and examined the patient .
I reviewed her laboratory , radiographic and EMTEK data and discussed the management with the Plastic Surgery and my Critical Care Medicine team .
The problems and management are as follows .
1. Acute renal failure .
The patient 's renal function seems to be improving .
Her BUN today is 45 and creatinine is 2.2 , and these are significantly lower from yesterday 's numbers of 64 and 2.8 .
Her potassium is 3.8 and she will get a dialysis on Saturday for the fluid management .
2. Respiratory failure .
The chest x-ray showed minimal improvement in her left - sided effusion and also in the atelectasis .
The patient is tolerating the pressure support ventilation of 8 and PEEP of 8 as long as she is not agitated .
Agitation really decreases her tolerance to be on the pressure support ventilation and that is why we had to switch her last night back to assist control again .
Today we will try back on the pressure support ventilation .
3. Mediastinitis .
The patient is continuing her six - week course of cefepime .
The white blood cell count came down appropriately and her fever curve is also responding well .
Her T-max was 37 in the last 24 hours .
4. ICU prophylaxis .
The patient is on Protonix for GI prophylaxis and heparin subcu for DVT prophylaxis .
She is also on sliding scale insulin for tight glucose control .
This is Dr. **NAME[WWW XXX] dictating the critical care medicine progress note for Ms. **NAME[BBB M. AAA] for my services provided on Friday , **DATE[Mar 23 2007] .
The total critical care time spent was 32 minutes .
