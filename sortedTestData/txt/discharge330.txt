1. Hypoxia .
The patient was found to have bilateral pneumonia after ruling out for a pulmonary embolism .
She did have a Condition C called on **DATE[Dec 24 2007] , which caused her to be transferred to the telemetry 3B unit .
The note in the chart does not indicate exactly why the Condition C was called , however , it is presumed that she had some respiratory distress , but her respiratory rate was 30 and at no time did she have an actual respiratory arrest .
The patient was initially started on Zosyn for her pneumonia .
Sputum cultures were obtained .
The patient 's sputum subsequently grew out Haemophilus influenzae , and she was changed to Avelox for coverage reasons .
She will be sent home on Avelox to complete a 14 - day course .
The patient was known to be hypoxic when she was admitted .
She has not used or worn oxygen at home prior to admission .
She was on 4 liters of oxygen at the time of discharge .
