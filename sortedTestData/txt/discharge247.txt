The patient would need a CABG at some point in the future .
However , the patient is not interesting in having the surgery at this time .
Therefore , she would follow up with Cardiology as an outpatient for further CABG planning .
On **DATE[Mar 13 2007] , the patient was deemed stable for discharge to home and was discharged to home in stable condition with the diagnoses of left orbital floor fracture , left lens dislocation , multivessel heart disease .
