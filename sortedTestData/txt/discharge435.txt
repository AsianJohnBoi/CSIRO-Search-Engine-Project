**INSTITUTION ADMISSION :
Mr. **NAME[AAA] was admitted for multiple falls including 12 falls in the 24 - hours prior to admission .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
Mr. **NAME[AAA] had for the 48 - hours prior to admission been having several falls .
He would , according to his sister , demonstrate some jerky motions of his upper extremities and then fall to the ground .
He would rise immediately with no loss of consciousness , no loss of coordination .
His baseline mental status did not change , with no event to the postictal state , no loss of bowel or bladder .
Due to these concerns the patient was admitted .
CT of the head was negative for acute processes .
The patient was afebrile with no infiltrates seen on chest x-ray .
He was started on all of his home medications .
On careful questioning it was revealed that patient had recently been taking Robitussin DM for mild upper respiratory infection symptoms .
It was felt that this medication , of which the time corresponds with his falling , was a possible cause .
It was felt that Robitussin DM may be interfering with his regular medications and decreasing the patient 's coordination .
A Neurology consult was obtained .
Several LAB tests were ordered including a TSH level , which was found to be 1.650 , and a CK level , which was found to be normal at 38 .
B12 and folate labs were also ordered .
Neurology did recommend obtaining an EEG ; however , it was not possible this EEG until after a long weekend , as the patient was not emergently ill .
The patient was having some discomfort with being in the hospital setting as he is more used to his home regimen where he lives with his sister in his home surroundings .
The patient had already had a previously scheduled Neurology appointment upcoming on Wednesday , **DATE[Aug 17]th .
After discussions with the Neurology Team , it was felt that the patient could be discharged home , as he is no longer exhibiting falling behavior since admission , with close follow up .
The patient was given a prescription slip for an EEG , which he will attempt to have scheduled on Tuesday morning .
The EEG is meant to rule out seizure activity although the suspicion for this is low given the patient was without any postictal confusion .
The patient will follow up with Neurology on **DATE[Aug 17]th .
He will also call his PCP to schedule close follow up within 1-2 weeks with his primary care doctor .
The patient was discharged home in the care of his sister in good condition .
