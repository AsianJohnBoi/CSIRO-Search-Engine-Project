1. Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis .
2. Hypothyroidism .
STUDIES :
1. CT of the head on **DATE[Nov 3 2007] , showed increasing microvascular ischemic change .
2. Renal ultrasound on **DATE[Nov 4 2007] , showed echogenic kidneys consistent with renal parenchymal disease .

4. MRI of the head on **DATE[Nov 8 2007] , showed extensive presumed small-vessel ischemic changes within the brainstem .
Supratentorial brain and left cerebellar hemisphere .
PROCEDURE PERFORMED :
A bone marrow biopsy was performed on **DATE[Nov 4 2007] , which showed a less than 10% plasma cell level .
**INSTITUTION ADMISSION :
Ms. **NAME[AAA] is a **AGE[in 60s]- year-old female with a history of smoldering multiple myeloma and membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis who presented from her office visit with anemia and thrombocytopenia and epistaxis .
The patient also had lab work , showed acute renal failure with elevated creatinine .
The patient also complained of fatigue and headache upon admission .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
1. Hematologic -- anemia -- the patient 's anemia was treated with transfusion upon admission and fatigue was improved .
The patient had iron studies which showed iron-deficiency anemia and was started on iron therapy upon discharge .
Thrombocytopenia .
The patient presented with platelet count of 41 upon admission with bleeding from her nose .
The patient was transfused platelets one time on the second hospital day .
Platelet count improved with transfusion , however , they continued to improve spontaneously and remained in the 60,000 range .
The patient was evaluated for TTP with peripheral blood smear and checking for hemolysis ; however , the patient did not have altered mental status and did not spike fevers and blood smear showed very few histocytes .
It was thought that it was not likely related to TTP .
Multiple myeloma .
The patient has a history of smoldering multiple myeloma with treatments with Cytoxan and steroids and had a bone marrow transplant in **DATE[Mar 2007] .
The patient 's multiple myeloma was worked up because of her renal failure .
It was thought to be possibly due to worsening multiple myeloma .
The patient 's M spike was not elevated .
It was 0.49 .
2. Acute renal failure .
Creatinine upon admission was 3.5 and over the next several days continued to increase to 4.7 .
The patient was started on hemodialysis on **DATE[Nov 6 2006] , after a tunneled dialysis catheter was placed in the right internal jugular vein by general surgery .
The patient was worked up for acute renal failure .
It was not felt to be postobstructive and not prerenal but somehow related to her multiple myeloma .
The patient had 24 - hour urine protein which was 7.22 gm per day .
The patient has a history of membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis which has been worked in the past , and all other etiologies were negative and was thought to be due to her multiple myeloma .
During her hospital stay , the patient 's renal function did not show signs of improvement and patient was discharged with hemodialysis followup .
3. Hypertension -- the patient was placed on nifedipine and continued on her level of atenolol and blood pressure remained stable .
4. Hypothyroidism .
The patient was continued on her home dose of Synthroid .
No active issues .
5. The patient had an episode of shortness of breath and was most likely related to some pulmonary edema , however , an echocardiogram was performed which showed a normal EF .
6. Headache .
The patient had headache that was relieved only with oxycodone .
A CT scan of the head showed microvascular ischemic changes .
A followup MRI which also showed similar changes .
This was most likely due to her multiple myeloma with hyperviscosity .
7. Fever .
The patient 's spiked a fever on hospital day 7 of 38.1 .
Cultures were drawn and were negative upon discharge .
The patient was on moxifloxacin for sinusitis and fever subsided .
