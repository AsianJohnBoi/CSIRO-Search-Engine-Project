Subjective
Complaints abdominal swelling - much improved s/p paracenthesis / minimal leak of serous fliud overnight d/w pt at length regarding treatment and need for close follow up - he understands and is aggreeable however , he is not agreeable to Acute ETOH rehab as it has not helped in the past and hearing about other peoples ' problems only makes him anxious .
He also is hesitant to go to out patient rehab as he may be called back to work .
He feels he can quit etoh on his own because he knows he will otherwise die .
I informed him that work is not an exuse as if he does not qiut etoh and go to all his appts and check his sugars regularly - he will not be alive to go to work .
He still is against rehab .
I told him we will set him up with rehab and it will be up to him .
