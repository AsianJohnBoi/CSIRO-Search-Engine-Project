HOSPITAL PRESENTATION :
Mr. **NAME[AAA] is a **AGE[in 50s]- year - old who had been having persisting low back pain and found to have hypercalcemia , anemia and renal insufficiency .
This gentleman was admitted to the teaching service and seen in consultation by Dr. **NAME[VVV] and laboratory studies suggested that there might be a possibility of underlying multiple myeloma .
The patient was seen by Dr. **NAME[UUU] , who recommended bone marrow biopsy which was performed .
The patient was placed on intravenous fluids and his potassium level dropped nicely .
Hemoglobin remained stable , but low , and the patient was placed on Aranesp .
His neuro imaging did not suggest that he would be a candidate for any surgery nor vertebroplasties .
Fortunately , his pain diminished significantly during his hospital stay and he required very little analgesia .
At the time of discharge , he was comfortable and he was on steroids along with his Aranesp .
Dr. **NAME[UUU] will see him in the outpatient setting over the next several months and prepare him for stem cell transplantation .
The radiation oncology folks saw him and did not feel he was a candidate due to his absence of cord involvement and his fairly pain free state at this point .
Mr. **NAME[AAA] was discharged in improved condition on the following medications :
1. Aranesp 400 mcg subcutaneously every Thursday .
2. Prednisone as directed by Dr. **NAME[UUU] .
He has analgesia at home .
PHYSICAL ACTIVITY :
He is not to work during his convalescence and treatment for multiple myeloma .
He is to avoid driving , avoid lifting .
DIET :
His diet is lowfat and low cholesterol .
FOLLOW UP :
Follow up with Dr. **NAME[ZZZ] in the outpatient setting .
Arrangements will need to be made for his Aranesp therapy and this will take place through the **INSTITUTION .
Ongoing monitoring of his renal status and calcium will be undertaken by the oncologist .
He will see Dr. **NAME[ZZZ] in approximately 1 month .
He knows to call us if he has any increasing pain , any fevers or chills .
The discharge calcium was in the normal range .
His creatinine was at 2.2 , his hemoglobin at 8.1 .
At the time of this discharge , Dr. **NAME[UUU] was considering transfusing him .
It was felt at this point his inpatient hospitalization had been maximized but it is understood that with his condition he may need to be readmitted in the future .
