HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is doing okay today .
She states that she actually feels little bit better .
She has had a biopsy today .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
She seems to have just some very mild proximal muscle weakness on her upper and lower extremities , but there was no distal extremity weakness , and she had some mild numbness in her feet bilaterally and on the lateral aspect of her left leg to light touch .
Her lungs revealed just a few crackles at the right base .
Her heart was regular .
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN :
Increased sedimentation rate , white count , and CRP which is being worked up at this point for rheumatologic evaluation .
She had biopsies .
We will see what the biopsy results show .
We will get an EMG and nerve conduction study .
If her temporary biopsy is negative and her EMG is positive , then we would biopsy her leg ; and if that is negative , then consider bone marrow biopsy .
If her temporary biopsy is negative , we may be able to proceed with further evaluation as outpatient after her EMG nerve conduction tests .
Her case is discussed in detail with the house staff .
I agree with their note as written .
My note should be considered as linked .
