HOSPITAL COURSE :
Mrs. **NAME[AAA] had known coronary artery disease and had a bypass procedure done perioperatively years ago .
She was admitted to the emergency room because of complaints of 3 days of chest pain on and off followed by a severe episode of retrosternal chest pain , radiating to her left arm that was associated with palpitations and nausea .
She took nitroglycerin without benefit .
She was taken to the emergency room and given a baby aspirin , nitroglycerin spray , and nitroglycerin patch with resolution of pain .
She had had a history of cardiac cath 2 years prior to admission when she was admitted under another service for congestive heart failure with atrial fibrillation , but her grafts were found to be patent .
She had had stable intermittent chest pain over months , but this accelerated in the days prior to admission leading to the hospitalization .
She was taking her medicines , was doing her usual activities .
As mentioned , she did have a few rales at her bases , was in regular sinus rhythm , and had no significant edema .
She was seen in consultation by the cardiologist and noted that she did have significant left ventricular dysfunction , had her cardiac catheterization in 2005 , and did have some occlusive disease as outlined but then overall her grafts were patent .
It was noted that during the hospitalization , her troponin levels remained normal and her cardiogram showed no evolution of ischemic changes , feel like making this unlikely to be myocardial ischemia .
It was thought possibly related to some mild increase in her fluid status and mild diuresis; an addition of metoprolol was recommended .
She had a nuclear stress test that was negative for significant ischemia and noted better ejection fraction of 50 % compared to the previous echocardiogram report 2 years ago of 30 % to 40 % .
Her pain remained under control during the hospitalization .
It was felt that her chest pain was probably noncardiac in origin and that the patient could be discharged to be followed up as an outpatient .
Chem-7 , bilirubin of 0.7 , SGOT 46 .
White count 5700 , H and H 14.1 and 42.6 .
Blood pressures also remained in the range of 126/64 .
