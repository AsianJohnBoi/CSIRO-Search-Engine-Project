Initial rectal temperature was 29.0 degrees .
She was aggressively warmed with a Foley and NG irrigation .
Breath sounds were equal bilaterally and the patient did maintain a normal pressure and heart rate .

A CT scan of the head and C-spine were negative for a fracture or bleed .
However , a CT scan of the abdomen did demonstrate a large number of 1.5 cm elliptical capsules with associated large amount of gastric fluid .
After aggressive warming measures were performed , the patient was transferred to an ICU bed for further monitoring of both her hypothermia and possible overdose .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to 4G ICU .
She was noted at that time to have somewhat improved in her GCS to about a 5 or 6 .
The GI fellow on call was contacted and the patient underwent gastric lavage with an Ewald tube .
Many small pills were extracted from her stomach .

Her NG tube was kept at low continuous suction .

She was also breathing normally with a GCS of 13 to 14 .
For this reason she was extubated and tolerated this well .
The Psychiatry Service was consulted regarding what appears to be an attempted suicide with both pills and exposure .

She will be transferred two **INSTITUTION for psychiatric management .
