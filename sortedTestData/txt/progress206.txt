I am managing this critically ill **AGE[in 60s]- year - old female who is status post sternal debridement for mediastinitis , status post CABG surgery .
Her hospital course has been complicated by respiratory failure , renal failure and fluid - overload .
I am seeing her for management of these issues .
I have seen and examined the patient and reviewed her laboratory , radiographic and Emtek data and discussed the management with the plastic surgeons .
Problems and management are as follows :
1. Respiratory failure .
Chest x-ray shows her bilateral pigtails in good position .
There remains a small left - sided effusion and subsegmental basilar atelectasis .
On the vent , I have her on assist - control .
Peak airway pressures are 30 with a tidal - volume of 500 .
This morning I switched her to 10 - cm water pressure support and she has been able to pool spontaneous tidal - volumes of around 500 .
I have switched her trach - mask trial this afternoon .
She looked somewhat tired later in the afternoon .
I suspect that she will need to rest back on the ventilator this evening .
I have pulled her left pigtail as the output has been less than 150 mL for the last 24 hours .
2. Mediastinitis .
She is in the middle of a six - week course of cefepime .
White blood cell count is down to 15,000 today .
I have ordered a repeat vancomycin level for the morning in order to re - dose her if it is less than 20 .
3. Renal failure .
BUN and creatinine continue to increase and are at 97 and 3.5 today .
Potassium is up to 5.3 .
I have given her an empiric trial of diuretics in order to optimize her fluid status .
I have also started her on some Kayexalate to help manage her potassium .
We are watching closely , but despite our best efforts and the Nephrology consultation , her renal function continues to deteriorate over the course of the last three to four days .
She maybe heading towards intermittent hemodialysis .
4. ICU prophylaxis .
We have ordered an albumin , pre - albumin and C-reactive protein to assess her nutritional status .
She is on tube feeds .
She has stress ulcer and DVT prophylaxis .
Total critical care time = 40 minutes .
