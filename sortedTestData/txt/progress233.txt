This patient continues to progress with not much change .
Yesterday she had an episode of SVT for which she required cardioversion .
She has remained very stable after that .
She still remains on the ventilator for respiratory failure which is the main reason why I still see her mostly because of failure to wean , failure to thrive .
Her heart rate is 60 to 70 .

We will attempt again new weaning protocol today .
