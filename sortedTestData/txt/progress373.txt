ADMISSION DATE :
**DATE[Apr 12 2007]
EVALUATION DATE :
**DATE[Apr 16 07]
I personally interviewed and examined the patient this morning and discussed the case with Dr. **NAME[XXX] .
She had a bad night last night .
She was up all night with what she calls burning pain in her abdomen .
The taper of her IV morphine did not work , and she is not yet on the full oral dose of pain medicine she took as an outpatient .
She feels that it may be because she did not have a bowel movement yesterday or has been constipated for several days and is now asking for a cathartic even though in the past she had said that might make it worse .
She has no shortness of breath .
No other significant complaints except her abdominal pain and her constipation .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
Vital Signs :
Blood pressure 156/90 , respirations are normal , and pulse is in the 70 .
She has a low - grade fever at 99.4 .
Head and Neck :
Unremarkable .
Lungs :
Poor inspiratory effort this morning .
Cardiac :
Unremarkable .
Abdomen :
Soft but is diffusely tender although some of the areas are not particularly reproducible .
Extremities :
Trace edema .
LABORATORIES :
Electrolytes , BUN , and creatinine were unremarkable with the exception of a persistent hypokalemia .
White count 10,700 , hemoglobin and hematocrit stable at 11.6 and 33 .
IMPRESSION :
1. Abdominal pain .
She is being treated for acid reflux disease somewhat more aggressively than she had been at home and that has not yet helped .
There is no evidence of intraabdominal pathology by laboratory or by x-ray .
I suspect this is an exacerbation of her chronic abdominal pain .
Although , it is possible that gastroesophageal reflux disease has played some component because she has gotten slightly better with more aggressive treatment of that .
We will continue to try to taper her pain medicines and get her bowels moving and get her up and around again so she can go home .
2. Hypokalemia .
We will replace her potassium with oral supplementation .
