Plan
SBO - Small bowel obstruction ( SNMCT **ID-NUM , Working , Problem )
LBO s/p Ex. Lap , Sigmoid Colectomy with End Colostomy ( POD #2 )
- Pt. 's pain has improved and stoma appears to be functioning well ; await Surgery input from today
- Final path .
report pending but intial was negative for Cancer ; However , elevated Ca-125 to 117 .
Non - specific .
Given that pt. has known cirrohosis with Portal HTN , that is the likely etiology for the elevation .
Nevertheless final path pending .
From Up TO Date Article about " Screening for Ovarian Ca "
However , the specificity of CA 125 is limited .
CA 125 is also increased in patients with other malignancies , including endometrial , breast , lung , and pancreatic cancer , as well as in a variety of benign conditions , such as endometriosis , uterine leiomyoma , cirrhosis with or without ascites , and pelvic inflammatory disease .
The presence of pleural or peritoneal fluid or disease involvement , whatever the cause , also increases CA 125 levels .
Furthermore , CA 125 levels are elevated in approximately 1 percent of healthy women , and they fluctuate during the menstrual cycle .
ACUTE RENAL FAILURE ( ICD9 584 , Working , Problem )
Pt. with progressively increasing BUN / Cr from 11/0.5 to 14/1.2 to 21/2.1 today
- Given only one dose of Lasix 40 mg IV , however failed to diurese with that
- UO has only been 20 cc per hour despirte being 2850 cc postive for the last 24 hours and 9268 cc since admission
- appears clinically dry however and urine very dark
- sent urine lytes ( UA , Creatine , Sodium , Osm ) because it is unclear to me whether this is prerenal vs. ATN vs. RTA
- Pt. does not appear fluid overloaded ( no resp. comprimise , no sig. edema ) but on Lasix 40 mg BID as outpt. so she may rely on lasix to mobilize fluid , also she may be third spacing given extent of surgery
- follow up on lytes and CARDS recs. , low threshold to c/s
RENAL DIARRHEA ( ICD9 787.91 , Working , Problem )
- one epidsode prior to this admission
- intial C. Diff negative
- Despite WBC elevation ( post - op ) given stool quality and symptoms , this seem less likely , but could repeat C Diff if index of suspicion remains elevated
HTN [ Hypertension ] ( ICD9 401.9 , Working , Problem )
BP has been ranging on the lower end ( 85/54 to 111/55 )
- presently on Clonidine 0.2 mg qweek as well as Lopressor 5 mg IV q 6 ( CARDS preop recommendations )
- prior to admission pt. on no meds explicitly for BP control as far as I can see from her Med Rec .
- Pt. also took Lasix 40 mg BID as outpt .
- Given tenous nature of BP would consider a lower dose of the clonidine patch
ATRIAL FIBRILLATION AND FLUTTER ( ICD9 427.3 , Working , Problem )
Pt. has been in atrial fibrillation with Pacemaker
- Rate has been in the 80s with Lopressor ( IV 5 q6 )
- Prior to admission on Sotalol ( D/C 'd by Cards )
- Pt. to take Atenolo 25 mg Daily when able to take PO ( per CARDS )
- Also was on Lasix 40 mg BID prior to admission ( unclear reasons why ) but ECHO does not indicate systolic dysfunction ( EF 61% ) but reather biatrial enlargement
- pt. anticoagulated ( secondary to prothrombotic state ) with coumadin with INR present 2.7
DM [ Diabetes mellitus ] ( ICD9 250.0 , Working , Problem )
- relatively poor control with Blood Glucoses being 167-212
- presently on D5NS with Low Sliding Scale Insulin q 6 hours
- change to moderate dose Sliding Scale
- hold Metformin , although with HgBA1c of 6.8 with this as outpt .
( consider Lantus )
Depressive disorder NOS ( ICD9 296.00 , Working , Problem )
I am assuming pt. with slightly more complicated diagnosis than just Depressive Disorder given that she was on Lexapro , Aricept and Namenda as outpt .
- will cont. Lexapro , but hold Namenda and Aricept fot now given that they are unlikely to make a difference acutely
- appears to reasonably oriented and in good spirits
CHRONIC LIVER DISEASE AND CIRRHOSIS ( ICD9 571 , Working , Problem )
- not active , but will check LFT s to assess serum Albumin and Protein with regards to RF , HTN
- if to tx. Portal HTN and regular HTN could consider non - specific
Beta - Blocker such as Propanolol
COPD [ Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ] ( ICD9 496 , Working , Problem )
No active pulmonary issues , but consider changing PRN Duonebs to Atrovent alone to prevent Tachycardia with Afib
Disposition
With Low BP and UO being tenous consider keeping in IMCU until stabilized
