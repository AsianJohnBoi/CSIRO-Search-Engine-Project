PATIENT PROFILE :
Mr. **NAME[AAA] is a pleasant , somewhat frail **AGE[in 80s]- year - old gentleman who is new to my practice .
Before his admission , he was seen twice in my office .
His wife , **NAME[XXX] , is well - known to me .
Mr. **NAME[AAA] was seen in the emergency room after he had noted a problem with his ambulation and with a visual field defect .
He had a CT scan done which showed an ischemic occipital stroke .
Dr. **NAME[WWW] , who knows the patient well from previous contact for a seizure disorder , was consulted .
An MRI could not be done since the patient has a pacemaker .
He was given aspirin as an anticoagulant .
OT and PT were consulted .
Initially , he was a bit confused , but this improved .
He is frail , and somewhat deconditioned , and therefore it was felt that he could benefit from a short - term rehabilitation stay , but both the patient and his wife decided to try to have the services at home .
An echocardiogram was done as per Dr. **NAME[VVV] , who is the patient 's attending cardiologist , who gave me a telephone report that his ejection fraction was somewhat depressed , but it did not show a major change from before .
Carotid Dopplers were done which showed minimal occlusion .
His lab work showed chronic renal failure and anemia which I noted when the patient came for the first time to my office earlier this month .
This apparently was chronic , with a BUN of 33 , creatinine of 1.9 and a hemoglobin of 10.4 .
An ultrasound of the kidneys was therefore obtained as well as a consult from nephrology in order to assess whether the patient will be a good candidate for Epogen .
This would certainly improve his general weakness .
The patient 's troponin was minimally elevated , and it was not felt that this was due to any cardiac event .
There were no further complications noted , and the patient was discharged home in improved condition .
He needs to follow up with Dr. **NAME[WWW] as directed , and with myself in a couple of weeks .
Dr. **NAME[VVV] will continue to see him .
He is to follow up with the renal service as directed .
