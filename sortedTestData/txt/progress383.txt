Impression and Plan
Impression
**AGE[in 70s] yo male admitted after syncopal episode found to have ulcerated duodenal lipoma , s/p endoscopic ligation .
Plan
1. GI - H/O duodenal ulcer .
Prevacid stopped 2-3 weeks ago by pt .
Heme + stool in ED .
EGD **DATE[May 16 07]:
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS :
1) Normal esophagus
2) Normal stomach
3) 2 cm submucosal mass with clean based ulcer
4) Small hiatal hernia
EUS to further evaluate the duodenal mass revealed a duodenal lipoma .
GI surgery , Dr. **NAME[TTT SSS] ( 13519 ) , consulted .
Endoscopic removal / banding preferred by pt.
On 1/18 pt. underwent endoscopic therapy by ligating with an endo - loop to allow strangulation and auto - amputation of the lipoma .
The lipoma should auto - amputate secondary to ischemic necrosis with time .
Will plan for repeat EGD in 2 months .
Pt resumed diet without difficulty .
Pt. denies any active bleeding .
GI reconsulted 1/24 for anemia .
They agreed with transfusing 2 units .
Rec. to continue daily PPI .
Given recent MI and stent placement will need to continue ASA and Plavix .
If there is an increase in active bleeding or H/H falls again , will consider repeat EGD to insure there is no ulceration or visible vessel at endoloop site amenable to endoscopic therapy .
Otherwise , will plan for repeat EGD in 2 months .
Suggested decreasing ASA to 81 mg if possible .
Will d/w attending and cards .
Rec. FESO4
325 mg daily as well as Colace 100 mg BID - will order .
2. Heme - H/H decreased to 8.4/24.6 1/24 .
As per attending , will transfuse to keep hematocrit near 30 .
H/H increased to 9.9/28.8 after 2 units PRBC s .
Stools heme + 1/21 .
Will recheck stools for occult blood .
Will continue to closely follow H/H daily .
3. CV - CAD , s/p angioplasty , HTN , Hyperlipidemia .
Troponins were initially neg .
Pt developed chest pain on 1/20 and now troponins + at a peak 47.41 and now trending down .
Pt transferred to the cardiac pavillion .
Started on a heparin gtt .
Pt 's cardiologist is Dr. **NAME[VVV UUU] - input appreciated. Dr **NAME[UUU] has seen pt. and explained importance of Cardiac Cath .
Pt and family discussed and agreed to undergo cath .
See attached TTE report that was done previous to MI .
Telemetry currently reveals bigeminy .
Pt was on plavix and d/c 'd due to GI bleed , resumed 1/22 by cards .
Currently on Heparin 900 units / hr - will hold on call to cath lab .
Pt. s/p LHC 1/23 .
Findings :
90% narrowing in proximal LAD , 90% narrowing with thrombus in mid LAD within previous stent , and 80% narrowing in previous stent .
S/P stent to proximal LAD and PTCA with good flow .
As per cards , if plavix must be d/c , the estimated risk of recurrent MI would be 5% .
If Plavix is continued , then risk is decreased to 1% .
TTE done 1/24 to assess LV s/p MI - results pending .
Pt. denies chest pain .
4. MS - H/O spinal stenosis .
Pt. s/p fall during syncopal episode .
X-rays negative for fracture .
Pt. was receiving morphine 2mg Q 2h prn for back pain .
Pt. developed intense itching on back with a large erythematous raised patch on the superior back thought to be from morphine .
Pt given Atarax and IV Solumedrol for itching .

Benadryl on call to cath lab .
Pt. with increased back pain since fall prior to admission .
Ortho c/s - appreciate input .
Recommended PT and anti - inflammatories .
Also Medrol Dose Pack for relief of pain exacerbation - pt. has been refusing Medrol Dose Pack .
Pt. with continued LBP .
Ortho reconsulted 1/24 .
5. Derm - Pt. with pruritic rash localized to upper back x 5 days .
Reports symptoms have improved with addition of hydrocortisone cream .
Derm c/s 1/22 .
Allergic contact dermatitis vs. irritant vs. primary eczema .
Possible allergic reaction to pillow .
Rec. to continue Atarax and Bendaryl 25 mg PO Q6H .
Will give hydrocortisone cream .

Baseline Cr. 1.5 - Cr. stable .
Urology c/s 1/24 for anemia .
Pt. without hematuria .
Given clinical hx , not suspecting urologic trauma at this point .
Will check U/A .
If greater than 100,000 RBC s , rec. to obtain CT abd and pelvis .
Otherwise , f/u with Dr. **NAME[RRR] in **DATE[Apr 08] .
