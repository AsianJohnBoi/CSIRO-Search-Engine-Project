**INSTITUTION :
The patient is a patient **AGE[in 70s] years of age unfortunately with a stage IV esophageal carcinoma .
She recently had a stent placed and was started on systemic chemotherapy with CPT-11 and cisplatin .
She developed increasing nausea and vomiting and rapid elevation of liver enzymes and dehydration .

She has been on Singulair , Synthroid , and atenolol for these particular problems .
She was brought into the hospital and started on IV therapy .
She was evaluated by Dr. **NAME[VVV] .
She underwent an endoscopy and unfortunately was found to have a near - complete obstruction of the esophagus .
At this point in time the case was discussed with Dr. **NAME[VVV] , and he recommended that we consider replacement of the stent , PDT , or laser treatments or some other treatment to reestablish some opening through the gastroesophageal junction .
At the present time , I did discuss the case with Dr. **NAME[YYY UUU] at **INSTITUTION .
He recommended the consideration for removal of the current stent with replacement of a covered silicone stent .
In view of the fact that the patient was not able to tolerate any oral intake , the patient was elected to be transferred to **INSTITUTION Hospital for placement of a covered stent and removal of the current nonfunctioning stent to establish gastroesophageal integrity .
The patient was totally intolerant of even fluids orally in the hospital and was placed n.p.o. and on chronic IV therapy .
She was also treated for a mild candida esophagitis .
The patient subsequently was transferred to **INSTITUTION for further care at this point in time .
