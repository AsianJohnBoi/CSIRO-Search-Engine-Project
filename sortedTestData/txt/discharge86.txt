**DATE[Jan 12 2008]
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS( ES ) :
Left ankle fracture overlying wound .
**INSTITUTION .
DISCHARGE CONDITION :
Good .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
This is a **AGE[in 20s]- year - old male who 9 - days prior was admission was jet skating in Florida when another jet skater hit him on the outside of his left leg .
He had ankle pain , a wound over his lateral ankle and also his medial proximal tibia and went to see doctor in Florida at that time .
In Florida , he was told that he had an open - ankle fracture and that he is to be admitted to the hospital and treated .
He elected to leave the hospital and fly back to **PLACE .
Four days prior to admission , he presented to **INSTITUTION with a history as described .
They again told him that he had what could be an ankle open fracture and that he should be immediately treated .
He again elected to leave and then 4 days later presented to the **INSTITUTION Emergency Department .
We were consulted there .
On initial examination , he was afebrile .
He had been on Bactrim orally but has completed that course .
His pain was relatively mild .
His vital signs were normal .
Examination of his leg revealed a moderately swollen ankle .
He has a healing and dry wound on his medial proximal tibia , which has been closed with sutures previously and it was healing without complication .
His ankle is tender to palpation about the lateral ramus where is also has about a 2 - cm linear laceration with very thin border surrounding erythema , which looks actually more like hyperemia from healing process .
They are not infection .
There is some serous drainage from the center of the wound but no gross purulence .
No obvious infection .
The wounds appear to be superficial and not tracking deep .
X-rays performed in the emergency department showed a very minimally displaced lateral malleolus fracture .
In the emergency department he was given Levaquin and placed in a short - leg splint and admitted for IV antibiotics and local wound care .
Prior to putting on the splint , his wound was irrigated with 1 L of normal saline and it was superficially debrided in order to a get a fibrinous dbris .
His wound looked clean .
On hospital day #1 , the day after being seen in the ER , his splint was removed .
He was given a **NAME[VVV] knee brace that could be removed to facilitate wound care .
Hydrogen peroxide 0.5% soaks were started and his wound appear stable .
His pain was stable .
He was afebrile .
He was maintained on the fluoroquinolone pseudomonas because of the seawater exposure as well as any other common aquatic organisms .
He tolerated the soaks well and as his wound was progressing and because of the equal availability of the fluoroquinolone as well as orally and parenterally , he was stated to be stable for discharge to home .
Before discharge , it was discussed with him that if he does begin to develop and infection and if this indeed was initially an open fracture , he does have a chance of developing a deep infection which could require multiple future surgeries to take care of .
In the worse case , he can even end up with an amputation and he understands this .
We told him that he should continue with his 0.5% hydrogen peroxide soaks and the dressing changes .
If he develops any increase in his redness from wearing this now or any increase in his drainage , any fevers , or increasing pain , he was instructed to call the Orthopedic Office .
He should continue with his ciprofloxacin 500 mg p.o. b.i.d.
He would wear a **NAME[VVV] brace and be nonweightbearing on the injured ankle .
He can use crutches for ambulation .
He will follow up with Dr. __________ in his office next Wednesday , **DATE[Jan 17 2008] .
Again , he understood the seriousness of his injury and the importance of proper care .
He was given prescriptions for ciprofloxacin 500 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Vicodin 5/500 one to two q.6 hours and Colace while in narcotics .
