I am seeing this critically ill man for management of cardiomyopathy , atrial fibrillation .
I have examined the patient , reviewed laboratory data , chest x-ray film and events of the evening .
He has right , greater than left , basilar atelectasis but a reasonable A-a gradient , a good cough and minimal secretions .
Hemodynamically I have continued on milrinone 0.15 mcg / kg / minute .
We have him off of the epinephrine .
He is warm and well - perfused .
He has gone into a rapid atrial fibrillation - about as high as 150 .
He initially responds to a low - dose of Cardizem , but his blood pressure is a little on the low side .
I gave him some IV calcium , followed by a single dose of Cardizem and he converted back to sinus rhythm .
Continue to follow him at this point .
We have him on Lasix 20 mg IV b.i.d. with the goal of trying to slowly optimize his volume status .
Renal function is 33 / creatinine of 1.2 .
Hematocrit is 28 .
No evidence of bleeding .
With still a significant amount of chest tube drainage yesterday we probably can remove the chest tubes tomorrow .
White count is 10,000 .
No evidence of infection .
Continue supportive-care as above .
T = 30 .
