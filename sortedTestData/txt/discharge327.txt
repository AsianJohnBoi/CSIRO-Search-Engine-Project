DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES :
1. Coronary artery disease status post stenting of the circumflex .
This patient has mild plaquing throughout the remainder of his coronary artery with no high - grade disease .
2. Chronic atrial fibrillation .
This patient is not a Coumadin candidate because of past bleeding .
3. History of a defibrillator .
4. History of chronic chest pain that was probably felt to be noncardiac .
5. Hypertension .
6. Hyperlipidemia .
7. Arthritis .
8. History of remote neurologic event in the brain in the 80s .
Mr. **NAME[AAA] is a **AGE[90+]- year - old gentleman who has been having recurrent chest pain .
He had chest pain also with adenosine infusion and a very mildly abnormal nuclear scan .
He was taken to the cath lab because he is a pretty good **AGE[90+]- year - old , in extremely good shape and is quite active , and is still driving .
We felt that if we can help him relieve his pain , this would be a necessary exercise .
We did find a circumflex lesion on a intravascular ultrasound .
It was critical and we did open it .
This patient tolerated the procedure well .
We put a non - drug - eluting stent in place because we did not want to commit this man for long - term Plavix .
The stent is a very large one , pushing up to 4 mm in size .
This patient 's postangioplasty course was uneventful .
He did have an episode of pain that we feel is noncardiac .
It was relieved partially with Mylanta .
I think that a lot of this patient 's symptoms are probably noncardiac now that we have been able to observe him in the hospital .
I did double his Protonix to 40 b.i.d.
We have left him alone .
He will probably need to be on Plavix for about a month just because of his non - drug - eluting stent , although , we probably will have to stop it long term .
Again , this patient is not taking Coumadin for his atrial fibrillation because of past bleeding episodes .
This patient had his defibrillator recently checked in my office .
He is clinically stable , and he is going to go home today .
He understands that should he have any chest pain , shortness of breath , or other medical problems , he should call immediately .
CONDITION :
Condition at the time of discharge is stable .
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS :
1. Aspirin q. day .
2. Plavix 75 a day .
3. Prednisone 2.5 every other day .
4. Protonix 40 b.i.d.
5. Amaryl 1 mg a day .
6. Pravastatin 40 a day .
7. K-Dur 20 b.i.d.
8. Imdur 30 a day .
9. Magnesium oxide 400 b.i.d.
10. Lanoxin 0.125 a day .
11. Lasix 40 b.i.d.
12. Albuterol and Atrovent inhalers , and Flovent inhaler .
