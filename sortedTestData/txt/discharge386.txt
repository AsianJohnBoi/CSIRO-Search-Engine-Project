DISCHARGE SUMMARY
This is a **AGE[90+]- year - old who was admitted to the hospital in **DATE[Sep] with intractable hip and back pain .
She received several injections during that admission and went to rehab , did reasonably well with rehab , but she had difficulties with a urinary tract infection , nausea and hyponatremia during that admission .
She went home and was doing poorly at home .
She had poor control of her pain , was taking Darvocet , Naprosyn , Tylenol .
She was subsequently put on a fentanyl patch and it caused nausea when she was in the hospital before .
She tolerated it reasonably well until three days prior to admission .
She had progressively increasing nausea and vomiting and persistence of her pain .
The patient was admitted to the hospital .
She was seen by the GI service and subsequently had an endoscopy which did show a peptic ulcer .
She was started on Protonix .
Her Naprosyn and Darvocet were discontinued .
She was continued on the fentanyl patch .
Her nausea did improve somewhat and she , as long as she moved her bowels , seemed to function reasonably well .
The patient has aortic stenosis and hypertension .
Her blood pressure was somewhat labile but reasonable during her admission .
The patient was seen by the pain service .
They injected her hip , although she did not get much immediate relief of pain .
Will need to wait for further evaluation .
The patient was found to be anemic on admission .
She had a mild anemia during her last admission .
It was more severe this time .
She was Hemoccult - negative .
The studies , her iron , B12 , and folate were all normal , and it was determined that it ( anemia ) was probably due to a prior bleed , although a reevaluation of this will need to take place if she does not improve in the next month .
She has a history of CHF and COPD , and these remained stable during her hospitalization .
She will be discharged to a skilled nursing facility to continue physical therapy .
Her ability to walk was significantly limited by pain , but she made good progress during her last admission to rehab and has a fairly good prognosis for that .
Patient will be followed up by me after she is discharged from the skilled nursing facility .
The discharge process took 35 minutes .
