Extremities show no significant changes in the right thigh and groin area .
Some tenderness , induration , and erythema continue .

Right thigh and groin pain thought to represent hematoma ; however , MRI findings are consistent with diabetic myonecrosis .
This is a relatively self - limited process , and treatment is supportive care and pain medication .
