I personally discussed the patient 's complicated past history with Dr. **NAME[TTT] upon transfer of care .
I personally rounded on the patient this morning and reviewed her computerized records .
I discussed her plan of care with the house staff .
I linked my note to the discharge summary dictated today upon transfer as previously noted in the chart to select a specialty , LTAC .
On morning rounds , the patient was in bed without any acute complaints of fatigue , but had some minor back pain that was somewhat relieved with change of position .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
Her blood pressure was 108/65 , temperature 97.5 , heart rate was 100 , and respiratory rate was 14 and unlabored .
Her lungs were clear although inspiratory effort was poor .
Cardiovascular :
Regular rate and rhythm .
S1 and S2 without S3 or S4 .
Ultrasound of the abdomen report reviewed by me with large cystic midabdominal fluid collection consistent with a known pseudocyst .
There was no visualization of the gallbladder .
LABORATORY DATA :
Sodium 138 , potassium 3.4 , chloride 104 , bicarbonate 26 , BUN 16 , creatinine 0.8 , SGOT 26 , SGPT 34 , alkaline phosphatase 533 , and GGT 207 slightly increased from 148 hours prior .
Amylase and lipase not drawn today .
Her WBC was 10.1 , hemoglobin 9.6 , stable , and platelets 463,000 .
The patient has multiple medical problems status post stent placement for coronary artery disease , but these appear to be stable at this time .
With respect to her pancreatitis and a large pancreatic pseudocyst , the recommendation by the GI Service would be for expectant management and not to plan any surgery at this point .
Her nutritional status has been addressed .
She has a trach in place status post respiratory failure , but with continued downsizing of the trach as she recovers , this may be likely to be removed .
She remains on aspirin and Plavix per Cardiology recommendations .
Anticoagulation with Coumadin was thought contraindicated due to the fact that she had some clean - based ulcers seen on EGD with placement of her tube .
The patient will require long - term rehabilitation to regain functional capacity .
She is stable for transfer to the above - mentioned facility today .
