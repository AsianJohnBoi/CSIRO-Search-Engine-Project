I am managing this critically ill , **AGE[in 40s]- year - old male who is postoperative day #1 from a repeat laparotomy with a washout in evaluation of mesenteric perfusion after repair of a superior mesenteric false aneurysm .
I am seeing him for management of his respiratory failure and his multiple medical issues .
I have seen and examined the patient , reviewed his laboratory , radiographic , and EMTEK data , and discussed the management with the vascular surgeons .
PROBLEMS AND MANAGEMENT ARE AS FOLLOWS :
1. Respiratory failure .
Chest x-ray shows endotracheal tube in good position .
His Duotube , which was placed in the Operating Room , is coiled in the back of his mouth , although the tip of the Duotube is posterior to the pylorus .
On the vent right now , I have him on assist control .
His peak airway pressure , his minute ventilation and gas exchange are adequate .
Today I have cut his fentanyl infusion in half and will do a pressure support trial to see if we can work on weaning and extubation .
2. Status post SMA repair .
Hemodynamics have been adequate .
His cardiac output and index are high , in the range of 10 to 12 liters a minute consistent with vasodilation .
Mean arterial pressures have been adequate as has his urine output .
I suspect that his vasodilated state will resolve over the next 48 to 72 hours .
He has not required any vasopressors and he is on prophylactic antibiotics including ciprofloxacin , Flagyl and vancomycin after his SMA repair .
3. ICU prophylaxis .
I have increased his prophylactic heparin to q.8 hours .
He remains N.P.O. at this point .
Will begin trickle feeding him in the next 48 hours or so .
I have fixed his coiled Duotube using a laryngoscope and Magill forceps and advancing it down the esophagus .
I have stabilized it down the esophagus and pulled the kink out of the Duotube and now it is in adequate position .
Total Critical Care time equals 40 minutes .
