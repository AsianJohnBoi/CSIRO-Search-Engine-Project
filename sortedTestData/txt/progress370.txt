ATTENDING PHYSICIAN :
**NAME[ZZZ M YYY]
ADMISSION DATE :
**DATE[Apr 12 2007]
EVALUATION DATE :
**DATE[Apr 13 07]
I personally interviewed and examined the patient this morning , and discussed the case with Dr. **NAME[XXX] .
I agree with the findings , impression , and plan as indicated in his note .
Today , the patient was admitted for increasing nausea , vomiting , and abdominal pain on top of chronic abdominal pain that is felt to be due to spinal stenosis .
Today , she still feels poorly .
She complains of persistent pain in her belly , although she no longer complains of nausea and vomiting and has had no diarrhea or other change in bowel movements .
She is complaining that the pain medicine wears away too quickly .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
Vital Signs :
Unremarkable .
She is non tachycardiac .
She is afebrile .
Lungs :
Show poor inspiratory effort .
Cardiac :
Examination reveals regular rate and rhythm with normal S1 and S2 .
Abdomen :
Soft .
It is diffusely tender with significant amount of guarding to light palpation .
Of note , I can palpate much more deeply when I listen with my stethoscope without reaction .
Extremities :
Show trace edema .
LABORATORY DATA :
Electrolytes , BUN , and creatinine are unremarkable with the exception of K of 3.3 .
White count is 8,400 and normal hemoglobin and hematocrit .
IMPRESSION
1. Abdominal pain .
She has chronic abdominal pain and this is one of many exacerbations that had brought her into the hospital multiple times .
There was a worry that she might have Clostridium difficile enterocolitis , because of a history of a recent bronchitis being treated by amoxicillin .
There is no evidence of systemic inflammation or infection .
Her belly is relatively benign and therefore while we await the C. diff toxin , we will restart oral liquids .
