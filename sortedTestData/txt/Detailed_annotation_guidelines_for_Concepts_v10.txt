Annotation Guidelines for Concepts v9
Ozlem Uzuner and Scott DuVall


The concept extraction task builds towards relation extraction task of the challenge. Therefore, from the wealth of concept and concept types that are found in clinical records, only a small subset that directly contribute to the relation challenge have been identified.  

This guideline describes the specific types of information that should be annotated for the concept extraction task and provides examples similar to those that may be found in the clinical text. The instances that should be marked along with examples of the surrounding text that should be included in the annotation are described.  Instances in this guideline marked in "BLUE" are correctly annotated concepts.  Instances marked in RED are those that should not be marked.

General Guidelines for Concepts
Syntactic forms of concepts:
Only complete noun phrases (NPs) and adjective phrases (APs) should be marked.
* The man was [obese].  The obese man came to the clinic.
* Patient underwent catheterization.  Catheterization report showed ...

Include all modifiers with concepts when they appear in the same phrase except for assertion modifiers.  (Please see assertion annotation guidelines for a description).
* "bilateral DVT"
* "recurrent angina"
* "high grade LAD lesion"
* "chronic hepatitis"
* "IV Ciprofloxacin"
* "cataract surgery"
* "diabetes medication"
* "head CT"
* "chest X-ray"
* no "fever"
* possible "tamponade"

Include the first prepositional phrase (PP) following an annotated instance only when the PP indicates either an organ/body part or when the PP and NP can be rearranged to eliminate the PP (we later call this the PP test).
* "lysis of adhesion" -> adhesion lysis
* "repair of ventral hernia"-> ventral hernia repair
* "placement of stent" -> stent placement 
* removal of mass from surface of transverse colon -> mass removal from surface of transverse colon (only include the first PP)

Include articles and possessive pronouns
* his cancer
* her medications
* the surgery
* an appendectomy
* patient underwent resection of his tumor

Semantic categories of concepts:
Concepts are defined in three general semantic categories that are each annotated separately.

1) Medical Problems: phrases that contain observations made by patients or clinicians about the patient’s body or mind that are thought to be abnormal or caused by a disease. They are loosely based on the UMLS semantic types of pathologic functions, disease or syndrome, mental or behavioral dysfunction, cell or molecular dysfunction, congenital abnormality, acquired abnormality, injury or poisoning, anatomic abnormality, neoplastic process, virus/bacterium, sign or symptom, but are not limited by UMLS coverage.

What should be annotated?  
> Medical problems need to be things that are wrong with the patient and can be treated.
> They need to be complete noun phrases (NPs) or adjective phrases (APs).  
> They need to be able to be modified with a negation modifier.  
> They need to belong to one of the above semantic types.  
   All four of these conditions have to hold.

Examples of Medical Problems to annotate:
a) Phrases that name a disease, syndrome, sign, or symptom
* Ativan 0.25  to 0.5 mg IV q 4 to 6 hours prn anxiety
- What was treated? anxiety. (NP, can be negated with "no anxiety")
* the wound was noted to be clean with mild serous drainage 
- Question test: What was treated? The wound. 
- Question test: What was treated? mild serous drainage.
- Question test: What was treated? Clean. --> wrong.
* the tumor was growing
- Question test: What was treated? The tumor.
* an echocardiogram revealed a pericardial effusion and possible tamponade clinically .

2) Treatments correspond to UMLS semantic types therapeutic or preventive procedure, medical device, steroid, pharmacologic substance, biomedical or dental material, antibiotic, clinical drug, and drug delivery device.  Other concepts that are treatments but that may not be found in UMLS are also included.

What should be annotated?
> In general, the annotated concepts need to be things that can treat a problem. They need to sensibly answer the question "what fixed the medical problem?"

3) Tests correspond to UMLS semantic types laboratory procedure, diagnostic procedure, and instances not covered by UMLS.

What should be annotated?
> In general, the annotated concepts need to be things that help determine whether the patient has a problem. Tests are analogous to treatments, but instead of fixing the problem, they are used to find more information out about a problem. They need to sensibly answer the question "what was done to find out if there was a medical problem?"
> They need to be complete NPs or APs.  
> They need to belong to one of the above semantic types. 
   All three of these conditions have to hold.
