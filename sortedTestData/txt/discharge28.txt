HOSPITAL COURSE :
This is a **AGE[in 70s]- year-old white female with history of COPD , asthma , chronic atrial fibrillation , hypertension , and breast cancer , who presented with cough for 2 weeks with left back pain for one day .
The patient was started on a CPAP for 2 weeks and p.o. steroids for her shortness of breath and coughing , but it was not getting better there , and he has had a new onset of left back pain which promoted her to the ER and got admitted for pneumonia , so on x-ray .
After the patient was admitted , she was given breathing treatment and also IV Solu-Medrol 1.5 mg once and then she was also started on IV ceftriaxone .
The patient 's left back pain was evaluated and ruled out for MI and the back pain never happened again .
Her shortness of breath and cough have also largely improved .
The patient was also seen by Dr. **NAME[VVV] from oncology to evaluate her breast cancer followup .
Basically , the CT showed no evidence of disease recurrence and lung nodule has seemed to be decreased which possibly was due to inflammation , so the patient is stable .
Symptoms much improved , so we are discharging her on p.o. antibiotics .
