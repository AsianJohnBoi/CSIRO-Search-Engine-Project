HOSPITAL COURSE :
This is a **AGE[90+]-year-old Caucasian female that only speaks Greek who was admitted on **DATE[Mar 24 2007] , after approximately 1 to 2 weeks of chest discomfort described as a pressure / bulging sensation on the left chest .
At that time , she denied any significant dyspnea or chest pain or coughing or sputum .
She also denies any tiredness or fever or malaise .
She was admitted from a skilled nursing home facility where she was started on moxifloxacin empirically for a possible pneumonia aAs per the chest x-ray and the very unspecific symptoms .
This patient had a chest x-ray during the hospitalization that showed unilateral pleural effusion .
For that reasons , we performed thoracentesis that showed an exudate without signs of malignancy on the cytological examination .
It is of note that this fluid had a high content of lymphocytes up to 81% and a low neutrophil count with 5% of the total WBC s .
This is an unusual finding for a parapneumonic effusion .
We also checked another chest x-ray to insure that the effusion was not progressing or infiltrates at the same time .
At the same time , we insured adequate oxygenation on the patient and we continued with the therapy with moxifloxacin IV .
The patient did not have any worsening of her condition .
As a matter of fact , she improved consistently during this hospitalization .
She was afebrile at all times and she did not have any significant dyspnea during this hospitalization .
At this time , she is afebrile , hemodynamically stable with a WBC count within normal limits and she is being discharged to the same skilled nursing home facility where she came from .
She had evaluation of PT/OT that I recommended the patient having 1 to 2 hours of physical therapy in order to regain autotomy .
This patient is going to be followed by Dr. **NAME[ZZZ] at the skilled nursing home facility and after this intensive therapy , she might be able to go home .
