FINAL DIAGNOSES :
1. Type 2 diabetes , uncontrolled .
2. Interstitial lung disease .
3. Edema state .
4. Hypertension .
5. Hypothyroidism .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
This is a well nourished white female who for the past 3 to 4 weeks has been having progressive swelling , shortness of breath , hoarseness , difficulty breathing , and generalized fatigue .
She has started to cough .
In the past week , she is on Synthroid due to chronic hypothyroidism , status post thyroidectomy , but went off of the medications , but these symptoms were starting before this .
She has been seeing psychiatry for her depression and has been placed on Lexapro 40 mg and feels she has been doing well .
She comes in with her mother today , looking extremely edematous with significant 2 to 3 + pitting edema , abdominal ascites , facial edema , and elevated blood pressure with difficulty breathing , hoarseness , and difficulty speaking .
Her skin is somewhat pallorous .
This is all new and she has never had it before .
She denies nausea , vomiting , or diarrhea .
She states that she became ill about 3 weeks ago with what she thought was more of a gastroenteritis .
She has not been out of the country .
At this point , it was felt that she needed to be admitted to the hospital to evaluate her condition and start her on appropriate therapy .
LABORATORY AND X-RAY :
The patient had an extensive gastrointestinal workup , with no definitive answers .
She had a fatty liver , hiatal hernia , and a dilated pancreatic duct with a prominent common bile duct with no evidence of obstruction .
She did complain of both hands and wrists paining her with arthritis , both knees paining , which were negative per x-ray .
These were treated with the use of ibuprofen .
She had a normal echocardiogram with only mild tricuspid regurgitation , a little diastolic dysfunction , but good left ventricular function , no evidence of any congestive heart failure , and chest x-ray was possible density in the left lung base .
A CT scan did show what appeared to be an intersitial / alveolar pattern .
She was seen by the endocrinology group , who restarted her Synthroid and started her diabetic care .
Blood sugars were markedly elevated with 11.3 hemoglobin A1c .
The pulmonary group saw the patient and started her on appropriate Advair treatment .
They were going to treat her for 6 weeks and repeat her CT scan .
If there was no change , or worsening , consider biopsy .
Her initial white count was 18,000 .
With hydration , it went down to 9.1 .
She lost approximately 5 or 6 pounds with intravenous Lasix in her edema .
Blood sugar was 417 , BUN 11 , creatinine 1.0 .
She did have mildly low sodium and chloride at 134 and 95 , which corrected to normal .
The BMP was entirely normal .
Her RA factor was positive with a RA titer of TT32 , which may need to be followed up in the outpatient setting .
CEA was normal .
Cancer study was normal .
Angiotensin converting enzyme was normal .
ANA was negative .
Her influenza titer was negative .
Pneumonia studies were negative .
Influenza viruses were negative .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
Uncertain as to what the exact etiology of her interstitial lung disease is .
She had been a smoker .
She did not have any further problems with any difficulty breathing .
Her cough was less .
Her hoarseness had improved .
She began to ambulate and was eating .
Appropriate diabetic instruction was started with the regional diabetic center and glucometry .
She was continued on her coverage along with oral medications and Lantus .
On two occasions she did have hypoglycemic reactions in the morning with blood sugars in the 50s and 60s , which were appropriately addressed by Dr. **NAME[WWW] .
DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS :
On **DATE[Aug 31 2007] , she had improved enough and would be followed by Dr. **NAME[WWW] for her thyroid and diabetes management .
We will continue to manage her general medical problems and Psychiatry will continue to see her .
She will go home on her medications , as noted on her medication discharge sheet , which we did review with her .
Specifically , we will manage Advair 550 a puff b.i.d. , Ultram 50 q.6 h. p.r.n. , Nexium 40 mg daily , and her
Synthroid 200 mg daily .
If indeed she has persistent pain in wrist and knee pain , we might consider a rheumatologic workup .
If she develops any problems from a pulmonary standpoint , we will see her sooner , or refer her off to Pulmonology .
Otherwise , a repeat CT scan will be done in 6 weeks .
She is going to go stay with her daughter and then with her mother , so I feel that she will have a lot of support and help during the time adjusting to all the medical problems that she has now developed .
We did answer her questions .
We did spend time going over her medications , explaining the situation with her .
The day before her discharge , Dr. **NAME[VVV] called on her esophagogastroduodenoscopy findings , which were essentially normal , and we will have her MRCP evaluated by a specialist in **PLACE to see whether indeed an ERCP needs to be done .
Unless she has any further symptoms , we will probably hold off on any further intervention at this time .
Overall , her prognoses should be good .
No other Social Service intervention is needed , just close medical follow up , which has been a problem with her in the past in her noncompliance .
Any and all abnormal laboratory work of any clinical significance , as discussed , will be followed up in the outpatient setting .
