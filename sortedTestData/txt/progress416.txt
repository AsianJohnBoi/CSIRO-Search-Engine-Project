I personally provided critical care services for this patient in the intensive care unit .
He is a **AGE[in 60s]- year - old male , who is status post left - sided CVA with hemorrhagic conversion .
He is intubated and mechanically ventilated and is being treated with cefepime and Flagyl for aspiration pneumonia .
He had a temperature maximum of 101.7 with a white blood cell count of 11 , which is slightly up from before .
He has been hemodynamically stable with 1.9 liters in and 3.7 liters out .
He is tolerating CPAP at 10 and 5 currently , but still has considerable secretions , which require frequent suctioning .
Cultures of these have been negative to date , and a chest x-ray remains surprisingly clear .
He is tolerating tube feeds and we are gently hydrating him with normal saline at 75 cc per hour .
His blood sugars are well - controlled with sliding scale insulin .
I spent 30 minutes of critical care time with this patient .
