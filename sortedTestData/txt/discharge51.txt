The patient was admitted to the hospital on **DATE[May 23 2007] , and is being discharged from CVU to Select Specialty on **DATE[May 29 2007] .
FINAL DIAGNOSES :
1. Pneumonia .
2. Sepsis .
3. Acute renal failure .
4. Thrombocytopenia .
5. Hypothermia .
6. Congestive heart failure .
7. Urethral stricture .
8. Disseminated intravascular coagulation
CONSULTS :
1. Dr. **NAME[VVV] was consulted regarding elevated troponin levels and CHF .
Plan was to treat heart failure with IV diuretics as medical therapy for acute coronary syndrome is limited due to thrombocytopenia and guaiac-positive stools .
Hold on Lovenox and heparin and aspirin .
2. Dr. **NAME[UUU] , was consulted regarding inability to insert Foley catheter .
He has impression of urethral stricture , and he inserted Foley catheter as well .
3. Dr. **NAME[TTT]/Dr. **NAME[SSS] were consulted due to thrombocytopenia and possible DIC .
Plan was to continue and follow CBC and platelets daily .
Repeat DIC and fibrinogen assays .
No intervention at this time .
PROCEDURES :
1. Venous Dopplers were performed on **DATE[May 24 2007] , negative for DVT or venous obstruction .
There was an old calcified thrombus which was not completely occluding one branch of the left popliteal vein .
2. CT abdomen was performed on **DATE[May 24 2007] , which showed multiple non-obstructing renal calcifications ; minimal bilateral hydronephrosis ; hydroureter ; small ascites mostly along liver margin .
Minimal distal abdominal aortic aneurysm .
3. V-P lung scan was performed on **DATE[May 24 2007] , showed low probability of PE .
4. MRI of the brain was performed on **DATE[May 26 2007] , showed no acute abnormalities .
There was lack of visualization of the right carotid flow , may represent slow flow versus thrombosis .
Carotid Dopplers were performed on **DATE[May 27 2007] , showed increased intimal medial thickness and flat fibrofatty plaque at distal portion of both common carotid arteries .
Right carotid internal artery was not visualized well ( not clear whether the vessel is completely occluded or not ) .
Left side shows fibrofatty plaque , mostly flat in common carotid and scattered heterogenous plaque at the bulb .
5. Echocardiogram performed on **DATE[May 24 2007] , showed a normal left ventricular cavity size , moderate - to - severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction with regional wall motion abnormalities , ejection fraction 25% to 30% , degenerative aortic valve disease with severe AS , mild-to-moderate AI , mitral annular calcification with moderate MR , severely dilated left atrial cavity , and moderate TR with pulmonary hypertension .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient is an **AGE[in 80s]- year - old white male , who came to the hospital as per wife 's request .
When wife was spoken to , the patient was noted to be fairly confused , not acting like himself for the past few days .
The patient was admitted to the hospital with altered mental status , weakness , CHF , acute renal failure , and pneumonia .
For the patient 's pneumonia , he was started on ciprofloxacin and Zosyn , which was continued for
7 days .
Chest x-ray showed gradual improvement and the patient improved quite well .
Mental status on the following day improved .
The patient was much more alert and cooperative .
With regards to the patient 's thrombocytopenia a DIC profile was obtained and the patient was diagnosed with some mild type of DIC .
Dr. **NAME[SSS] was consulted ( see above ) , platelets gradually increased over the patient 's stay .
Cardiology was consulted regarding the cardiac heart failure and positive troponin levels .
There was no treatment given for the acute coronary syndrome as the patient 's platelets were very low .
We did , however , start him on a beta-blocker and lipitor .
The patient was diuresed with Lasix on the first initial days of his stay .
However , this was discontinued as the renal failure worsened .
With regards to the patient 's renal failure , BUN and creatinine levels have gradually decreased .
Currently , they are 35 / 1.2 ( initially when the patient was admitted 85 / 1.8 ) .
As the patient is doing fairly well , we are discharging him to Select Specialty , where he will be followed by his PCP .
