We advanced his diet this afternoon since he is no longer having complaints of nausea .
2. Mild aspiration pneumonia .
His x-rays showed there is some retrocardiac infiltrates .
Official reading is still pending .
We will continue him on Unasyn therapy for now .
We will have speech evaluation .

We will continue his metformin and rosiglitazone and hold until the morning of the surgery .

Continue his home regimen .
The VESIcare does not seem to have any effect on memory .
5. History of coronary artery disease .
He denies any problems with chest pain , dyspnea on exertion at this time .
His EKG revealed basically some Qs and 3 in aVF which is consistent with his recent EKG of **DATE[Jul 2007] .
Based on the reading , there was no acute ST elevation or depression .
Perioperatively , he will be continued on his nitrate and beta blocker .

Case was discussed in detail with the house staff .
I agree with their notes written .
