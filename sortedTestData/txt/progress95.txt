Plan
Disposition
1. Sinusitis
- on Day 3 of Zithromax .
Feeling better today .
- congestion loosening .
Pt coughing more as a result
2. s/p Fall
- main concern at this time is patient safety at home
- would favor more aggressive PT with a possible evaluation for acute rehab .
Pt would benefit from acute rehab
3. Borderline Tacchycardia
- pt 's HR fluctuating between high 90 's and high 110 's
- no evidence for acute cause such as sepsis , DVT / PE , CVA , A-fib , or orthostasis
- would recheck orthostatics today , including an assessment of HR during this measurement
- Etiology at this point likely the fact that the pt has not been taking her Lopressor for 6 months
- if orthostatics negative , may favor increasing Lopressor to 50 BID
4. DM ( 141 , 170 , 124 , 163 )
- HgBA1C = 6.2 -- Excellent
- pt started on Actos 15 Daily yesterday .
No problems with tolerance yet .
- In light of prior non-compliance and excellent A1C , may even favor decreasing Actos to 7.5 mg Daily
5. HTN
- on prinizide 12.5 / 20 and metoprolol 25 BID currently
- BP slightly higher today than yesterday .
If orthostatics negative , may favor increasing Lopressor to 50 BID
6. Hyperlipidemia
- on lipitor 10 mg currently .
Lipid panel pending
7. CAD
- stable on ASA
8. Placement
- pt safety is the main concern at this point .
- would favor more aggressive PT / OT today .
Pt has not ambulated since admission
- pt would benefit from acute rehab / gait training / home safety evaluation .
Would consider evaluation to see if pt qualifies for inpatient rehab on 4A
Addendum by **NAME[XXX , WWW] on **DATE[Jun 04 2007] 10:41 AM
Pt was seen and examed by me .
Case discussed with medical student of **NAME[CCC VVV].
Agree with the plan of above .
- recheck orthostatic BP + HR , if neg. increase b-block to 50 bid for her hr controlled .
- Waiting for sw and pt final report .
trying to move her to acute reh. in 4A .
