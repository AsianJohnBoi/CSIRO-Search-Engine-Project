I am currently seeing this patient of **NAME[YYY ZZZ] 's on Thoracic Service .
She is status post bilateral lung reduction surgery .
She has had a complicated postoperative course .
I am managing her for respiratory insufficiency , renal failure , volume overload , and electrolyte abnormality .
I examined her and reviewed her laboratory data , chart data , and chest x-ray .
She , hemodynamically , remains hemodynamically stable .
She is clinically warm and well perfused .
From a respiratory standpoint , she has now been off the vent for going on 36 hours which she is tolerating quite nicely .
She is in renal failure .
No evidence of recovery at this point in time .
I will continue to aggressively try to get volume off of her in light that she is volume overloaded .
We are removing 150 mL off an hour .
Her phosphate was low which I did supplement .
She is on enteral nutritional support which she is tolerating .
She is on DVT and GI prophylaxis .
At this point in time , there are no infectious disease issues .
So , currently , we will continue her current supportive care and management .
Critical care time equals 31 minutes .
