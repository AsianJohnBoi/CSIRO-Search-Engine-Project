HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient is a **AGE[in 70s]- year - old woman with an extensive history including osteomyelitis of the left first toe last year which involved 6 weeks of Levaquin therapy followed by 2 months of vancomycin , started on Flagyl therapy after Levaquin appeared not to be effective .
She presents with 4 days of second toe pain , swelling , and ulceration , though her outpatient record does show that she had some erythema and swelling in the same toe in **DATE[Apr 2007] .
She has had some difficulty walking due to the pain and ulceration .
She was started empirically on vancomycin , Cipro , and Flagyl while here .
X-ray of the right foot was performed which did not show any osteomyelitis , so we did an MRI which did show osteomyelitis of the DIP joint .
At that point , we continued the patient on vancomycin , Cipro , and Flagyl .
She got a PICC line in order to prepare for outpatient IV antibiotic treatment .
Dr. **NAME[CCC] was consulted and agreed with our plan and will follow the patient in 1 to 2 weeks .
Dr. **NAME[SSS TTT] was consulted .
He felt that this patient may require amputation at the DIP joint because of severe ulceration and osteomyelitis .
The patient was unwilling to go ahead with amputation .
In the near future , she wanted to see whether the antibiotics would treat her toe infection and prevent her from losing that toe .
She will follow up with Dr. **NAME[TTT] as an outpatient in 2 to 4 weeks to reconsider amputation depending on progress of the infection .
DISCHARGE DISPOSITION :
To home with home care for IV antibiotic treatment .
Follow up with Dr. **NAME[RRR] in 1 to 2 weeks .
Follow up with Dr. **NAME[TTT] in 2 to 4 weeks .
Follow up with Dr. **NAME[CCC] in 1 to 2 weeks .
