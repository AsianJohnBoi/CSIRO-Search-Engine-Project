DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS :
Sickle cell crisis .
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE :
Stable .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient is a **AGE[in 50s]- year - old African American female with a past medical history significant for sickle cell disease , hepatitis C , ischemic colitis , and atrial fibrillation who came into the emergency room on **DATE[Apr 7 2007] , with a chief complaint of 3 - day history of cough , fever , abdominal pain , and vomiting .
She reports that the cough was productive of yellow - green sputum for the past several days prior to admission and that she had a fever in the morning prior to coming to the emergency room .
The abdominal pain is chronic , but she reported this was worse than usual and was accompanied by nausea and vomiting .
She has had multiple hospitalizations for exacerbation of her sickle cell disease with crisis as well as the abdominal pain and infection .
In the emergency room she was evaluated and had an EKG done which showed sinus tachycardia at 116 beats a minute with T - wave inversions that were new compared to her baseline EKG .
She had a chest x-ray which showed mild interstitial edema and an ill - defined right lower lung air space opacity which was felt to be due to pneumonia or less likely infarction .
Abdominal x-rays were done which showed no radiographic evidence of obstruction or pneumoperitoneum .
A CT of the abdomen and pelvis was then done without contrast and a preliminary report showed no acute abnormality .
She had blood work done in the emergency room as well which showed a sodium of 143 , potassium 4.4 , chloride 114 , CO2 of 22 , BUN 30 , creatinine 1.3 , calcium 8.6 , magnesium 1.6 , phosphorus 2.9 , total bilirubin 2.9 , ALT 50 , AST 55 , alkaline phosphatase 92 , and GGTP 37 .
Troponin level was negative at less than 0.1 .
Lactate normal at 0.7. WBC 17.5 , hemoglobin 7.1 , hematocrit 21.0 , MCV 89.6 , and neutrophils 68% .
She was admitted to the MICU as there was no step - down bed available .
She was given a dose of ceftriaxone and azithromycin in the emergency room for treatment of community acquired pneumonia and was also given morphine for pain control .
A unit of blood was transfused in the emergency room prior to her admission to the unit .
In the emergency room , she was monitored closely and kept on telemetry secondary to her history of atrial fibrillation .
Her abdomen was rather evaluated with an MRI on **DATE[Apr 11 2007] , the results of which showed a segment 2 liver lesion which had increased in size since **DATE[Aug 2005] secondary iron overload cirrhosis without findings of portal hypertension and bilateral pleural effusions with dependent atelectasis .
Her blood work was monitored throughout hospitalization and she was noted to have an increasing creatinine to a high of 5.6 .
Renal Medicine was consulted and it was determined that she would benefit from hemodialysis and therefore she was started on a
3 - day - a - week course of hemodialysis while here at **INSTITUTION .
The dialysis was effective for also eliminating some of the fluid overload as she did have small to moderate amounts of ascites present secondary to her liver disease .
Additional liver workup was done which included a positive cryoglobulin screen with characterization showing a positive type 2 containing polyclonal IgG and monoclonal IgM .
She also had a confirmation of the hepatitis C antibody being present , and a hepatitis B surface antigen and core antibody done both of which were negative .
She did have difficulty with fluid retention as well and needed to be placed on Lasix in addition to the dialysis for control of that .
We continued her on the antibiotics for the treatment of the community acquired pneumonia and she did resolve .
She was showing some changes in mental status , which were felt to be consistent with hepatic encephalopathy and therefore was maintained on lactulose .
Her ammonia levels remained within the normal range .
She had complaint of a sore throat and a strep test was done which was positive .
She was then placed on amoxicillin for that .
She complained of some hearing loss and ENT was consulted and started her on Floxin Otic drops .
For her atrial fibrillation , she was controlled on Cardizem .
Palliative care was consulted to help with her pain management and they had been working in conjunction with her primary hematologist Dr. **NAME[YYY ZZZ] for pain control .
She continued to improve throughout her hospitalization and was felt to be stable for discharge on **DATE[May 3 2007] .
She had dialysis in the morning and then is to go home .
On the day of discharge her blood work showed a sodium of 143 , potassium 4.2 , chloride 106 , CO2 of 29 , BUN 36 , creatinine 3 , glucose 108 , phosphorus 5.4 , magnesium 1.3 , and calcium 8.5 .
WBC 15.5 , hemoglobin 11.7 , hematocrit 36.5 , platelets 134 , and neutrophils 78% .
She will be discharged today to home .
