I personally manage Mr. **NAME[AAA] in the ICU .
He is a **AGE[in 60s]- year - old man with a history of left - sided stroke complicated by intervascular bleeding and risk for continued edema .
He also has a history of aspiration for which he is on Unasyn .
His echo of his heart shows low cardiac function of around 20% which will be a contributing factor to his multiple organ system insufficiency .

He grimaces to painful stimuli .
He remains extubated .
