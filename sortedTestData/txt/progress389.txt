On my evaluation today , the patient was starting to wake up nicely , followed commands and denied any distress .
Examination of the heart revealed S1 and S2 present .
Lungs revealed diminished breath sounds at both bases .
Abdomen was soft and nontender .
With regards to the game plan for the day , I placed him on a CPAP 5 , pressure support 5 trial ; he seemed to be doing well on that .
