EVALUATION DATE :
**DATE[Mar 28 07]
Mrs. **NAME[CCC] is a **AGE[in 60s]- year - old woman status post lung volume reduction surgery .
She continues to require critical care for management of her respiratory failure , fluid overload , adrenal insufficiency , renal failure , and malnutrition .
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN :
1. Pulmonary .
Respiratory failure .
I am currently managing Mrs. **NAME[CCC] on assist control ventilation , rate of 14 , tidal volume of 400 , 55% FiO2 , and 5 of PEEP .
I will continue to wean her FiO2 as tolerated to maintain an oxygen saturation of greater than 88% .
Breath sounds are somewhat diminished at the bases .
She continues to have some blood - tinged sputum .
I will continue suctioning with a red rubber catheter at this time .
Chest x-ray shows bilateral basilar atelectasis and small effusions .
She is significantly volume overloaded .
I will continue hemodialysis in an attempt to maintain a net negative fluid balance to improve her pulmonary status .
2. Cardiovascular .
Extremities are warm and adequately perfused .
She is in a sinus rhythm in the 90s with mean pressures in the 70s .
She is not requiring inotropic or pressor support .
3. Infectious disease .
Afebrile with a T-max of 36.9 and a white count of 9.1 .
She was started on Zosyn empirically due to concerns of a left lower extremity cellulitis .
At this time , the lower extremity appears less like cellulitis and more erythematous and tender due to her edema .
I will discontinue her vancomycin and discuss her previous fluid culture with Dr. **NAME[TTT] which grew coagulase - negative staphylococcus .
I will not provide further doses of vancomycin at this time .
At this point , it would be reasonable to stop both antibiotics .
4. Fluids , electrolytes , and nutrition .
Sodium is 136 , potassium is 4.3 , and magnesium is 1.8 .
I have replaced electrolytes as per protocol .
5. Renal .
Acute renal failure .
I am continuing hemodialysis .
She was ultrafiltrated yesterday for 1.4 liters .
I will attempt to get between 2 and 2.5 liters of ultrafiltrate off today .
BUN is 51 with a creatinine of 2.9 .
I am hopeful that her hemoptysis will improve with correction of her uremia .
6. Endocrine .
Hyperglycemia .
We will continue sliding scale insulin coverage to maintain euglycemic control , hydrocortisone due to adrenal insufficiency , and her baseline dose of prednisone .
7. Hematology .
Hemoglobin this morning is 7.8 with a platelet count of 134 and an INR of 1.3 .
We will check an H&amp ; H later this afternoon and , if her bleeding continues , administer another dose of DDAVP .
8. GI .
Abdomen is soft and benign .
She is tolerating TwoCal at 30 mL per hour via her PEG tube .
9. Neuro .
Awake and alert .
She moves all extremities .
She does not appear to have a focal neurologic deficit .
10. Prophylaxis .
A lower extremity duplex was performed and does not show , at least preliminarily , a left lower extremity DVT .
She does have a known right - sided DVT , and an IVC filter is in place .
Heparin is currently on hold given her hemoptysis .
I will continue Prevacid for GI prophylaxis and head of the bed elevation .
Critical care time = 32 minutes .
