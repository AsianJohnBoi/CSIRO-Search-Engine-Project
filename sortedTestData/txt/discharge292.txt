The history and physical examination are as previously documented without addition , deletion or correction .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to the hospital after being found on the floor of her personal care home .
She was admitted to a monitored bed and had serial cardiac enzymes performed .
These were mildly elevated and she was seen in consultation by Dr. **NAME[VVV UUU] .
Dr. **NAME[UUU] felt that the minor elevations did not represent evidence of ischemia but were rather attributable to her renal function .
She had an echocardiogram done which showed left ventricular hypertrophy with septal hypokinesis .
Her left ventricular ejection fraction was 50% , and there were no significant valvular lesions .
She also had blood cultures done to evaluate her relative hypotension .
These grew E. coli .
A subsequent urine culture showed no evidence of urinary tract infection .
Because of this , a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis was performed to look for other sources of the bacteremia .
The CT scan demonstrated thickening of the cecum with possible cecal mass most likely representing adenocarcinoma of the colon .
There was no evidence of diverticulitis or intra - abdominal abscess .
She was seen in consultation by Dr. **NAME[TTT] of gastroenterology and Dr. **NAME[SSS] of infectious diseases .
They both felt that the cecal pathology was the most likely portal of entry for her Escherichia coli bacteremia .
Dr. **NAME[TTT] recommended colonoscopy for definitive diagnosis .
However , the patient and her family decided that since they were unwilling to consider surgery , that there was no point in pursuing colonoscopy , and thus declined further evaluation .
Of note , a CEA was within normal limits and iron studies were equivocal .
Her E. coli bacteremia was initially treated with Zosyn and she was subsequently transitioned to oral ciprofloxacin , adjusted for her renal insufficiency .
It was recommended by infectious disease that she remain on long-term suppressive therapy since the likely portal of entry was not being removed .
Her glycemic control was adequate on Actos during the course of her hospitalization .
She was also seen in consultation by Dr. **NAME[RRR] Young of rheumatology who recommended low - dose nonsteroidal anti - inflammatory agents for treatment of her polymyalgia rheumatica since the patient refused further treatment with corticosteroids .
On **DATE[Feb 30 2007] , it was felt that she was well enough to be transferred to a skilled nursing facility .
