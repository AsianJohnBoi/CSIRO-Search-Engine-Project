TRANSFER DIAGNOSIS ( ES ) :
METHICILLIN - RESISTANT STAPHALOCOCCUS AUREUS SEPTICEMIA .
CONSULTS :
Infectious Disease .
PROCEDURE :
Transesophageal ecchocardiogram .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a **AGE[in 50s]- year - old male with history of CAD , CHF , an AICD placement , sinal node dysfunction , schizophrenia , depression , COPD and diabetes , transferred on **DATE[Jan 19 2008] from the **INSTITUTION in order to have a transesophageal ecchocardiogram under intubation .
The patient had presented originally to an outside hospital , **INSTITUTION , in the end of **DATE[Nov 2007] , for syncope , he was having fever , chills , etc .
He was diagnosed with methicillin - resistant Staphalococcus aureus urosepsis and subsequently treated with 14 days of vancomycin .
On **DATE[Dec 22 2007] he was transferred to the **INSTITUTION for further management .
At that time he was still culture positive for methicillin - resistant Staphalococcus aureus .
He was maintained on vancomycin although peaks and troughs were not readily available and unsure whether he was therapeutically treated .
He did have some complications including episodes of hypotension and was febrile , but was stabilized .
Somewhere around **DATE[Nov 05] or **DATE[Nov 05 2007] he was culture negative and was transferred to Aspinwall for continued therapy but was re - transferred back the same day as the patient was not stable .
He again had methicillin - resistant Staphalococcus aureus positive blood cultures on **DATE[Nov 07] , **DATE[Nov 08] , **DATE[Nov 12] , **DATE[Nov 13] and **DATE[Nov 15 2007] , and was started on the addition of Synercid on **DATE[Jan 12 2008] until **DATE[Jan 17 2008] and then transferred to the MICU at **INSTITUTION .
He needed a transesophageal ecchocardiogram and it was thought that he would need , given his psychiatric condition , thought that he would need intubation .
The patient did not need intubation .
He had a transesophageal ecchocardiogram which was normal .
Infectious Disease was consulted .
He was transferred off the floor given that he was stable and put on telemetry on a regular floor .
He remained afebrile .
He had one culture drawn which was out of his arterial line IJ which had been placed on **DATE[Jan 08 2008] and that was positive for methicillin - resistant Staphalococcus aureus but his peripheral sticks were all negative on **DATE[Jan 19 2008] .
He was started on vancomycin , gentamycin and rifampin with the goals of vancomycin being 20 to 25 levels and gentamycin peak being 2 and trough being 1 .
He was afebrile and all other blood cultures were negative .
On **DATE[Jan 21 2008] the VA called and requested the patient be transferred back , which is what is happening right now .
The patient is at baseline , not very communicative .
I have spoken with his family several times and they feel that this is his baseline when he is sick .
When he is not ill he tends to be more talkative , he can walk around the house , etc .
Here in the hospital here he has been on restraints and strict bed rest because he is well responsive , not very communicative ; he also has some baseline tardive dyskinesia from all of his multiple medications .
For the rest of the hospital course , please see Hospital Course by Systems .
IMAGING :
The patient only had an transesophageal ecchocardiogram .
It showed mildly dilated left ventricle and moderately decreased systolic function , the ejection fraction was 30 to 35% , he had mild pulmonic regurgitation and atherosclerosis of the aortic arch but no evidence of endocarditis .
LABORATORY DATA :
The patient 's electrolytes were within normal limits .
His creatinine was 1.3 to 1.5 , which seems to be about his baseline .
His blood sugars were 127 to 325 on just a sliding scale insulin .
His white count on admission was 15.1 ; on the day of transfer was 14.1 with 70% polys , 16% lymphs and 13% monos .
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS :
1. I.D.
Infectious Disease was consulted .
The feelings are several .
The patient has several foreign bodies , an AICD , recent stent placement and the lens that is in his eye .
I.D. felt that the stents and the eye lens were very unlikely to be seeded .
They did feel that the leads of his AICD could be infected .
Electrophysiology was consulted .
I.D. and Electrophysiology came to the conclusion that if he was adequately treated for four weeks and still had positive cultures that he would need his AICD removed , so that would be in **DATE[Feb] .
Until that point , Infectious Disease felt that he was probably inadequately treated on vancomycin given his troughs of lower than 15 .
The feeling is that we will maintain him on " gent ," " vanc " and rifampin for the next month and keep drawing blood cultures every so often to make sure that he is still negative .
If he is negative after a month they can discontinue treatment .
If he is still having positive cultures in a month he will have to have his AICD removed .
Currently he is on vancomycin 1,500 mg IV q.24 and gentamycin 70 mg IV q.12 and rifampin 300 mg p.o. b.i.d.
His most recent vancomycin trough was 21 .
We have no recent peaks .
His recent gentamycin trough was 1.2 and peak was 2.9 , which are both in good ranges .
As I said , all of his blood cultures have been negative except the one on **DATE[Jan 16 2008] which was drawn from his ART line .
He needs that ART line drained .
We were going to have a PICC put in given that his blood cultures have been negative for four days today but we are transferring him , so at the VA he will need a PICC line placed and his IJ removed .
Will leave the IJ in as peripheral access is not an option .
We had the IV team come three times and they could not get a line in him , so it will need to be central .
I think that the PICC is the best option .
The patient remains afebrile .
2. Cardiovascular .
Blood pressure has been high .
The patient is on hydralazine .
He cannot have an ACE inhibitor because he has bumped his creatinine on an ACE inhibitor and he cannot have a beta blocker because of sinus node dysfunction , so if another agent needs to be added we would have to discuss that with the team .
He was on Lasix which I have been holding because of his increased creatinine .
He does not seem to be fluid overloaded at this point .
His hemoglobin has been trending downward .
He is Hemoccult negative .
We have not seen any obvious signs of bleeding .
It is possible that he is getting bone marrow suppression from the multiple antibiotic regimen and this will need to be followed .
Hemoglobin was 9.1 and then 8 and now today it is around 7 .
3. Pulmonary .
COPD .
The patient is on duo - nebs .
His saturations are stable .
He is on CPAP at night .
4. Renal .
The patient has a bump in his creatinine .
When he was put on ACE inhibitor it went from 2.5 to 10 .
It is now resolving .
It has stayed at about 1.3 to 1.5 .
His Foley was recently changed on admission on **DATE[Jan 16 2008] and his urine culture was negative , so he no longer has methicillin - resistant Staphalococcus aureus in his urine .
5. GI .
The patient 's glucose has been controlled with Lispro , sliding scale and NPH 12 units subcu b.i.d.
He is on a soft diet and Senna and Colace for a bowel regimen .
6. Psychiatry .
This seems to be the patient 's baseline when he is ill .
When he is not ill it seems that he speaks and walks around , etc .
Will continue his Seroquel and Zoloft .
He has Ativan p.r.n. for agitation although that has not been used while he was in here .
The patient has been tried on Haldol during the MICU without success , so in the event of agitation Ativan is recommended .
DISPOSITION :
The patient is being transferred in an hour to the VA .
He is to continue his current regimen of antibiotics for four weeks .
His gentamycin will need to be watched closely with is renal failure and maintaining a low peak of around 2 rather than the recommended peaks .
It could be considered with Infectious Disease that maybe the gentamycin could be stopped because he probably has adequate coverage with his vancomycin and rifampin .
This can be discussed with the new team .
If anyone has any questions about the patient 's care while he was in **INSTITUTION , he can page the **INSTITUTION paging system .
My pager number is ***PHONE .

1. The patient is on duo - nebs 3 mL aerosolized q. six hours .
2. Aspirin 81 mg p.o. q. day .
3. Carvedilol 6.25 mg p.o. b.i.d.
