The patient is a **AGE[in 50s]- year - old female well until **DATE[Jan 2007] when she presented with AML and a bone marrow biopsy showing
80% to 90% cellularity and 62% blasts .
AML was categorized as M4 with multiple cytogenetic abnormalities .
She underwent idarubicin and ARA-C induction with a day 14 bone marrow biopsy showing less than 5% blasts .
A followup bone marrow biopsy in **DATE[Feb 2007] showed less than 5% blasts ; however , cytogenetics were consistent with residual disease .
Her blood counts were allowed to recover , and bone marrow biopsy done on **DATE[Mar 23 2007] , noted relapse disease with 80% blasts for which she underwent re-induction with mitoxantrone and etoposide .
A bone marrow biopsy done on day 14 noted persistent disease with 22% residual blasts , and at that point , she was transferred to the bone marrow transplant service for transplant .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
1. AML .
The patient began conditioning with busulfan and cyclophosphamide which she tolerated well .
Day 0 was **DATE[Apr 21 2007] , at which point , she received her stem cell infusion for a total dose of five times ten to the sixth CD34 - positive cells , and she engrafted her white blood cell count on day plus 15 .
2. Graft - versus - host disease .
She received cyclosporine and methotrexate graft - versus - host disease prophylaxis .
She did not receive methotrexate on day 11 due to severe mucositis .
At the time of discharge and for a few days prior to discharge , the patient noted tenderness on her fingers and her heels which have remained unchanged which has been attributed to her busulfan .
3. Infectious disease .
During the course of the hospitalization , the patient was on meropenem and vancomycin which she was on when she transferred from the leukemia service .
