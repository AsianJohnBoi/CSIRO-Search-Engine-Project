HISTORY :
This is one of the several admissions for this **AGE[in 80s]- year - old white female who has been a long-term resident at Tandem Health Care skilled nursing facility .
Apparently , 2 to 3 days prior to admission , she was noted to have some intermittent fevers and some steady progression of mental status changes .
She had been seen by Dr. **NAME[XXX] who normally follows her at that facility .
Urine culture was done and reportedly normal .
She had been reportedly positive , although we did not have those final reports .
She was empirically started on some Cipro , but apparently had only received one dose .
Her status deteriorated and she was transferred to the emergency department for further evaluation .
She was eventually admitted .
She did have one fever while in the emergency department .
She was started on Cipro 400 mg IV daily .
Blood cultures were done , but reportedly negative .
Urine culture was not available , but likely negative because of the ongoing antibiotic treatment .
She had MRSA culture for Staph and this was not available at the time of dictation .
She also had a slightly elevated troponin levels , but on prior admissions these had been elevated on numerous occasions , possibly related to her mild renal impairment .
She was a little bit dehydrated .
She was placed on a regular floor , continued on Cipro , and started on IV fluids .
Potassium was replaced .
Magnesium was replaced .
Calcium was replaced .
She responded nicely later in the morning , on the day of discharge .
She was seen again and felt well .
She was awake , alert , talking , activity levels normally are very sedentary and requires assistance to get up out of bed under normal circumstances , although , she is not eating particularly well , on discharge she was taking fluids .
The dehydration was corrected .
Electrolyte disturbances were corrected .
