PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
Vital Signs :
Her blood pressure today was 124/77 .
Her pulse was 89 .
Her temperature was 97.8 .
HEENT :
Her oral mucosa was moist .
Neck :
Supple .
I did not feel any discrete nodule .
She had a right carotid bruit .
Lungs :
Significant for crackles at her right base .
Heart :
Normal S1 and S2 .
She has 1/6 murmur at the left midsternal border .
Her PMI was nondisplaced .
Breasts :
Without prominent mass , dimpling , or retraction .
I did not feel any significant axillary or cervical adenopathy .
Abdomen :
Soft .
She has some mild tenderness in her epigastric region today .
Her bowel sounds were positive and normoactive .
Extremities :
Some trace edema in her ankles .
She has extensive vitiligo changes in her skin .
I did not see any clubbing .
Neurologic :
Strength exam , she had some mild weakness to her left grip and has had some just very mild drift on the left .
Her finger - to - nose was on target .
Her lower extremity strength , I thought , was 5- / 5 bilateral and symmetric .
There was no clonus , no Babinski .
Her face was symmetric .
Extraocular movements were intact .
There were clear __________ .
She did look quite pale .
LABORATORY DATA :
She was quite anemic with white count of 14 today .
Hemoglobin was 7.6 .
Her platelet count was 675 .
Her white count was 596 .
The last time she was in the hospital , she had high ferritin , low iron saturation consistent with probable anemia of chronic disease .
She has a sedimentation rate today of 120 .
Her C-reactive protein was 22 .
Her chest x-ray was read as unremarkable .
She had blood cultures drawn yesterday , which are negative at 1 day .
UA is still pending .
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN :
1. Complaints of weakness and leukocytosis with increased muscle achiness .
With her elevated sedimentation rate and CRP , in general a vague symptomatology , I suspect that she may have vasculitis .
She does have persisted hematuria in her urine .
She could have PAN , possibly of temporal arteries given her headaches .
We plan on setting her up for a temporal artery biopsy .
We will have Rheumatology see her again to do an EMG nerve conduction study if her temporal artery biopsy is negative .
If she has evidence of neuropathy then we would consider a nerve biopsy .
There is not any apparent malignancy , but if our evaluation for vasculitis is negative , then we will ask Hematology to consider bone marrow biopsy .
She obviously has some significant illness causing her to develop a profound anemia of chronic disease and general inability to function .
We need to determine what that chronic disease is .
2. Crackles on her lung exam .
X-rays reportedly are negative .
She just had a CT scan last admission .
This admission would consider repeating high - resolution CT scan of her chest to reevaluate her right lung if her vascular workup is negative .
3. Anemia and vitiligo .
We will check a B12 although I think her main problem is anemia of chronic disease .
We will make sure there is no associated B12 deficiency as well .
4. Hematuria .
We will repeat a urinalysis today .
Her renal function is normal .
I suspect that her hematuria maybe associated with her illness .
5. Hypertension , controlled .
Her case was discussed in detail with the house staff .
I agree with their note as written .
My note should be considered linked to theirs .
