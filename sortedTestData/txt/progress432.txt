ATTENDING PHYSICIAN :
**NAME[WWW M XXX]
ADMISSION DATE :
**DATE[Aug 02 2007]
EVALUATION DATE :
**DATE[Aug 05 07]
The patient is going to be transferred to **INSTITUTION .
Her discharge diagnoses are COPD , delirium , dementia , significant mitral regurgitation , anorexia , and no nodules .
The patient states that she is doing okay today .
She just does not have a lot of energy .
She would like to get some help with her memory and is not opposed to going to **INSTITUTION for them trying to help her with that .
She actually been much less agitated in the last 2 days compared to the first day that she was admitted where she just basically walked around constantly asking people to take her home .
She has not really done that for the last 2 days .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
Per exam today , she has a few rhonchi .
Her heart was regular with 2/6 murmur at the apex .
Her abdomen was soft and nontender .
Her extremities were without significant edema .
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN :
1. Dementia .
She is going to go **INSTITUTION for adjustment in her medications and also for the treatment of her anorexia .
I suspect that she may have a component of malnutrition that contributes to her worsening dementia recently , although , it sounds like she had some mild baseline dementia .
We tried to get MRI scan here prior to transfer and were unsuccessful and we recommended she get that over at **INSTITUTION just to complete the workup .
2. Mitral regurgitation and heart failure .
We added ACE inhibitor to her medications .
Her blood pressure is on the low side , so we did not add a beta - blocker as well .
She also has significant COPD , so we will hold off on adding beta - blocker therapy at this time for both of those reasons .
3. Pulmonary nodules .
She will have to have a followup CT in a few months just to reevaluate those areas .
The radiologist thought it was more likely inflammatory etiology .
She does not have evidence of significant infection at this time .
She did complain of some cough intermittently , which is a chronic problem for her .
Her case was discussed in detail with house staff .
I agree with their note as written .
My note should be considered linked to theirs .
