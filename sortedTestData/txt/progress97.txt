ASSESSMENT AND PLAN :
This is a **AGE[in 20s]- year - old gentleman with history of chronic granulomatous disease who has stable pyogenic liver abscess and was admitted a week ago for pneumonia that was thought to be __________ .
BAL was supposed to be done and has not been arranged for .
The patient now returns with fever , malaise , chills , and rigors .
At this point in time , I am going to focus on lowering his temperature using acetaminophen orally and per rectum .
I would consider Demerol if needed .
We spoke with the Infectious Disease Service .
They are going to see the patient urgently .
I think that the patient is septic , however , I am not sure if its bacterial , and there is no role of empiric antibiotics at this point in time .
I am going to continue the itraconazole established by the ID Service previously .
Given the absence of peritoneal signs , I am not keen on scanning his abdomen urgently .
However , we did discuss with the Infectious Disease possible imaging , and they asked us to wait until they see the patient .
Cultures were sent .
We made sure that they are in the lab .
We also contacted Pulmonary Service to see the patient for BAL and the evaluation for pneumonia .
I did discuss this plan with the patient and his mother .
