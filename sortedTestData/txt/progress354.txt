I am currently seeing this **AGE[in 50s]- year - old patient , status post bilateral lung reduction surgery who has had a complicated postoperative course with ICU issues of respiratory insufficiency , renal failure , volume overload , electrolyte abnormalities and nutritional support .
I am also managing her for hyperglycemic control as well .
I examined her , reviewed her laboratory data , chart data and chest x-ray .
She hemodynamically remains hemodynamically stable , but had marginal blood pressures this morning , did get some volume back early this morning , but since then her means have been in the 60 mmHg range .
She is in a normal sinus rhythm with her heart rate in the 80s .
Otherwise , she is clinically warm and well perfused .
From a respiratory standpoint , she continues on aerosolized trach mask now for 48 hours plus , doing well with saturations of 95 to 97% and clinically appears to be comfortable from this standpoint .
From a renal electrolyte standpoint , she is still volume over - loaded , in renal failure on CVVHDF , removing 100 mL off an hour .
Her phosphate today was 1.9 and this was supplemented .
Concerning her I 's and O 's , she had 800 mL of ultrafiltration , but still positive a liter .
Will try to push up her volume a little as she tolerates hemodynamically .
She is on enteral nutritional support with TwoCal HN at 30 mL an hour which is tolerating and for hyperglycemic control she is on NPH 5 units subQ twice a day as well as moderate scale q.6 hours .
Otherwise , she continues on prednisone for replacement therapy for adrenal insufficiency .
She is on DVT and GI prophylaxis .
Hematocrit remains stable .
Critical Care time = 30 minutes .
