I am seeing this critically ill woman for management of her respiratory failure , mechanical ventilatory support , glycemic control , nutritional support .
I examined patient , laboratory data , chest x-ray film .
From a respiratory standpoint , she has interstitial lung changes , left greater than right .
She became increasingly tachypneic last night and was rested back on full mechanical support .
Her trach was changed today because she had a cuff leak .
I would keep her on the vent until after planned procedure .
She is going to undergo a new tunnel dialysis catheter placement today .
She is warm and well perfused with good refill .
Mean blood pressure runs about 62 to 64 with a systolic of 85 .
She is off of dialysis obviously because of the absence of a line .
Her blood sugar was as low as 38 and that was because her tube feeds were held this morning .
She is going to be given some IV fluid , would reinstitute her NPH once her tube feeds are restarted .
Hematocrit is 24 , white count is 5.4 .
She has a significant rash which is a couple of weeks old , but it appeared to be getting worse ; that is why I stopped her Cipro .
The other possible drug that may be doing this is Zoloft which may cause rash and I would discontinue that and begin her on a low dose of Celexa instead .
Continue supportive care as above .
