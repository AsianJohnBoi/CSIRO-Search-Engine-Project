EVALUATION DATE :
**DATE[Apr 29 07]
Currently , I continue to see this **AGE[in 50s]- year - old patient status post bilateral lung reduction surgery complicated with ICU course .
The remainder of her respiratory insufficiency , doing trach mask trials since **DATE[Apr 23 2007] , renal failure , volume overload , electrolyte abnormality , and some hypoglycemia .
I examined her , reviewed her laboratory data , and chart data .
Hemodynamically stable at this point in time .
Means are now up into the 70s .
She is clinically warm and well perfused .
No issues from this standpoint , in sinus rhythm .
From a respiratory standpoint , as previously mentioned she has been off the vent since **DATE[Apr 23 2007] , clinically doing well from this standpoint on trach mask , anywhere from 36% to 40% trach collar .
She was hypoglycemic today .
She is on NPH and a moderate sliding - scale .
NPH dose is 5 b.i.d. , which I will hold .
She is enteral nutritional support with TwoCal HN at 30 mL / hour which she has been tolerating .
Otherwise , she is in renal failure .
No evidence of recovery .
She is hypophosphatemic with a phosphate of 1.4 , which I did supplement .
Clearance is adequate 24 / 1.3 .
She did restart Prisma today with a UF of 100 , in light that her blood pressure has been followed , I will increase the UF to 150 mL an hour .
I put her back on Prisma this morning .
Her blood pressure is relatively marginal , and I think we will be able to take off volume on her in the setting of her blood pressure .
So , we will continue her on Prisma for this reason and try to get volume off her at night if she is still volume overloaded .
She is still neutropenic today .
Her white count is 1.9 with only 9 neutrophils and a few bands , so she is absolute neutropenic with an ANC of less than 500 .
I did give her another dose of Neupogen .
I did review her medication chart again with our __________ , who rounds with us , and there is nothing else that could be contributing to this .
So , I gave her another dose of Neupogen today , and we will follow her white count tomorrow .
If it does not respond , I might have to get Hematology involved .
She is also a little bit more erythematous .
On talking to her family , she has very sensitive skin , has to use mild soaps at home ; so , I did order everything to be hypoallergenic at this point in time , to see whether or not this also helps .
The family did this at one point in time , and her erythematous had improved significantly .
She is not pruritic at this point in time .
So , at this point in time , otherwise we will continue her current support care management .
CRITICAL CARE TIME = 32 MINUTES .
