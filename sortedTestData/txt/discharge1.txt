HISTORY :
Mr. **NAME[AAA] is an **AGE[in 80s]-year-old pleasant man who was discharged recently to **INSTITUTION Rehab after a long admission for throat , renal failure , sepsis , and severe pneumonia .
He was doing well at the rehab ; however , on the night before the day of admission , he started to have diarrhea .
He did not respond to treatment .
C. diff toxin was sent , but the patient became hypotensive , his creatinine went up to 2 and BUN became elevated .
He became tachycardic , and showing irregular heart beats .
For all these reasons , he was transferred to **INSTITUTION for further management and evaluation .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted with initial problems that included severe diarrhea confirmed later to be from C. diff colitis , it was treated with Flagyl and Lactinex and seemed to improve slowly .
His other issue was hypotension and tachycardia related to dehydration and low volume .
It was corrected with IV fluids .
He had renal failure on admission , the creatinine was 2.0 and elevated BUN .
That seemed to correct with IV fluids , creatinine improved down to 1.2 .
He was tachycardic and showing irregular heart beats on admission , that seemed to improve to normal sinus rhythm with controlled rate at the time of discharge .
The patient had swelling in the right arm , there was question of DVT .
However , venous Dopplers came back negative .
I would still watch that closely , consider further evaluation if the swelling continues .
The patient continues to have the problem with dysphagia .
He is on dysphagia diet .
However , his main complaint and problem seem to be persistent congestion in the lungs and sputum production and cough .
He had recent pneumonia which seemed to be getting better on CT scan and chest x-ray .
I wonder if he has either components of microaspiration or postnasal drip which could be contributing .
Appropriate treatments are being given to that .
Other agents could be added later in the future .
As the patient seemed to improve from the diarrhea standpoint and as his kidney function coming back to normal , his blood pressure and heart rate are improving , we felt that he could go back to the **INSTITUTION Rehab to continue physical therapy and rehabilitation .
He will continue his medications .
He needs to follow up with his right arm swelling and his lung status .
LABORATORY DATA :
Prior to discharge , his stool for occult blood was negative .
His sodium was 140 , potassium 3.9 , chloride 119 , BUN 17 , creatinine 1.4 , calcium 8.2. His INR was 21 , TIBC 1 was 7 and iron saturation was 20% , ferritin 251 .
Hemoglobin was 9.0 , hematocrit 26.8 , and platelet count 255 .
DISPOSITION :
**INSTITUTION Rehab in stable condition .
Continue to follow at that institution .
