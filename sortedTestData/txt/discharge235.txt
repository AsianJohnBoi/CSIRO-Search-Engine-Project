She is going home on Cipro 250 b.i.d. x 14 days .
We will give her some Flomax 0.4 mg q.day , and we will also give her some Vicodin ES q.i.d. p.r.n. for a month .
The family knows to call my cellphone number for these medications , so that will give me a chance to talk to them and see how she is doing .
Her discharge diagnoses include multiple renal stones , pyelonephritis , obstruction ureteropelvic junction stone , rule out .
Her case was discussed with Nephrology .
Case was discussed with Urology on the day of discharge per Dr. **NAME[XXX] .
She had pain and fever , and she would have required stent , but her stone was very small .
Fever came down clinically .
We will still treat it as possible pyelonephritis , treat her for 14 days .
I explained to the mother clearly that if she gets recurrent pain or if she develops fever , she walks back into the emergency room even without calling me and then we will need to stent her .
Today , she wishes to go home , and I do not see any reason to hold her .
Her temperature was 37.6 , heart rate 68 , breathing 18 times per minute , saturating 100% , blood pressure of 110/42 .
Her lab studies .
We do not have any labs from today , but yesterday , her sodium 136 , potassium 3.7 , chloride 104 , CO2 of 23 , anion gap of 9 , BUN 5 , creatinine 0.9 , amylase 70 , lipase 83 , WBC 6.1 , hemoglobin 11.5 , hematocrit 33.3 , platelets 166 , c-reactive protein 3.27 .
Her urine culture actually did not show any growth , but the first urine culture showed nonlactose fermenting gram - negative rods .
A urine HCG was negative .
So there are 3 processes going on at discharge .
First is her renal stones .
The etiology of renal stones will be looked into by Dr. **NAME[WWW] .
We will be checking a 24 - hour calcium , uric acid , creatinine .
We will also be trying to do a stone analysis , checking uric acid .
Second problem is pyelonephritis and possible obstruction .
She may need a stent depending upon her course .
Third problem is elevated C-reactive protein .
GI doctor was little worried about that , and he wanted to rule out Crohn 's disease .
He is going to get some antibodies testing done and then we will have her see him later for a possible colonoscopy .
