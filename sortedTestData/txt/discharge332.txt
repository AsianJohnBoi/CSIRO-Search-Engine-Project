DISCHARGE DATE :
**DATE[Apr 02 2007]
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS :
FEVER , QUESTIONABLE SEPSIS , STATUS POST PANCREAS TRANSPLANT .
REASON FOR ADMISSION / HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
This is a **AGE[in 40s]- year - old female who had a pancreas transplant on **DATE[Mar 03 2007] , who had come to 7 West for routine lab work , was found to have a blood pressure of 80/50 , and had a temperature of 103.7 at home .
She only complained of fatigue and some crampy lower abdominal pain , increased urination , and some dysuria .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
She was admitted , and a fever work - up was started , including blood cultures , viral cultures , stool cultures , and urine cultures , all of which proved to be negative .
Transplant and Infectious Disease consults were obtained , and they felt that given that she had an abdominal surgery , we should check an abdominal CT , which was done and was negative .
We also checked a CT of the chest which was also negative .
They felt that since the donor was from Mississippi , which is an endemic area for Histoplasma , they would check
Histoplasma urine antigen and fungal cultures of the blood .
Nothing turned out to be positive .
As she was status post transplant , it was felt that Campath fever was a less likely diagnosis .
However , when all of her cultures were felt to be negative , we decided to give an empiric dose of 250 mg of
Solu-Medrol .
This was given on **DATE[Mar 30] .
Also , some changes in her medications were made , such as stopping magnesium and stopping her Bactrim .
During her stay , her amylase and lipase fluctuated , and her LFTs were elevated .
The LFT s did begin to improve once we stopped her Bactrim , but had still not come back down to normal at the time of discharge .
After her dose of Solu-Medrol on **DATE[Mar 30] , the patient 's symptoms completely resolved .
She looked better , her diarrhea had gone away , and her nausea and vomiting resolved .
However , a biopsy of her pancreas was obtained on **DATE[Mar 31] , and following this , she developed some moderate pain over her allograft , and that is when we did the CT of the abdomen and pelvis , which showed no hematoma , but what looked like allograft pancreatitis .
The transplant biopsy pathology did not show any pancreas tissue .
Thus , it was decided by Dr. **NAME[ZZZ] to treat her for a presumptive rejection .
She received another 100 mg of Solu-Medrol .
On **DATE[Mar 31] , they were going to attempt to repeat the biopsy , but , as the patient was having such discomfort , this was cancelled .
On **DATE[Apr 01] , the patient did have a positive urine culture return with 50,000 colonies of Enterobacter cloacae , and she was started on ciprofloxacin 400 mg IV daily .
She received a second dose of Solu-Medrol 250 mg IV times one on **DATE[Apr 01] , and then on **DATE[Apr 02] , Solu-Medrol 100 mg IV times one .
On **DATE[Apr 01] , the patient 's symptoms had completely resolved , no more nausea , vomiting , or diarrhea , and her pain over the allograft had resolved .
She was stable to be discharged to home .
