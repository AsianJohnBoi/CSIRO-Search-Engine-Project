BRIEF HISTORY OF HOSPITALIZATION :
The patient is a **AGE[in 60s]- year - old female with a history of COPD , who presented with increasing shortness of breath 1 day prior to admission .
She was admitted with the diagnosis of COPD exacerbation .
The plan was to start her on DAT s , O2 , IV steroids , and continue her Singulair .
There was also concern about a possible community acquired pneumonia , so she was started on ceftriaxone and azithromycin .
We plan to check her thyroid level and continue her Synthroid .
Continue her Plendil for her blood pressure , and continue her Zocor for the cholesterol .
During the hospital stay , the patient was seen in consultation with Dr. **NAME[VVV UUU] , and also Dr. **NAME[TTT] from her office saw the patient .
She did well during her hospital stay .
There was a repeat chest x-ray done which did not show any pneumonia , so the ceftriaxone was discontinued , but she was continued on
Zithromax for a presumed bronchitic picture .
The patient had her Medrol slowly decreased over the continuing days of her hospital stay .
She also had her Synthroid adjusted to a lower dose , as her TSH level was low at 0.134 .
On the day of discharge , the patient was seen and was in no acute distress .
The plan was to discontinue her oxygen , and to send her home on a steroid taper , to resume aspirin , and to recheck her TSH in 6 weeks .
The patient was stable at the time of transfer .
