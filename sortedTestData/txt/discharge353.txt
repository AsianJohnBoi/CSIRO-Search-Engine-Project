HOSPITAL COURSE :
Briefly as follows :
**NAME[BBB AAA] is a pleasant **AGE[in 60s]- year - old lady who originally presented to outside hospital on **DATE[Aug 30] with a complaint of epigastric discomfort that was concerning for possible cardiac origin .
She was felt to possibly have some ST depressions on an EKG .
Cardiology was consulted and proceeded with cardiac catheterization , which resulted in stenting of five vessels .
Within several days she had actually thrombosed two stents , which was treated with AngioJet therapy .
She unfortunately went on to develop respiratory failure requiring intubation .
Her course continued to be complicated by Pseudomonas pneumonia , gastric ileus , development of antibiotic associated C. difficile diarrhea , thrombocytopenia , and ascites requiring paracentesis .
She subsequently underwent tracheostomy on **DATE[Sep 15] at the outside hospital .
She was found to be intolerant of enteral feedings , and a CT scan was done on **DATE[Sep 16] , which demonstrated evidence of acute pancreatitis as well as a 10 cm x 7 cm large pancreatic pseudocyst .
It was felt that most likely the pseudocyst was the source of the enteral feeding intolerance by causing gastric outlet obstruction .
She was then transferred to **INSTITUTION for further evaluation .
She had a short course of TPN from **DATE[Sep 16] through **DATE[Sep 24] .
Following arrival at UPMC - Presbyterian she was successfully weaned off the ventilator .
She did have her course here complicated by development of a right internal jugular vein thrombosis , as well as acute otitis media .
After being seen by GI Surgery and GI Nutrition , her TPN was discontinued .
She underwent upper endoscopy , which demonstrated some evidence of gastric antral erosions likely due to recent instrumentation with NG tubes at the outside hospital .
After successful weaning from the ventilator she was transferred to a regular medical floor unit and unfortunately the NGJ tube that had been placed endoscopically developed clogging of the J portion of the tube .
She then subsequently underwent replacement of the NGJ tube and was initiated on Lovenox therapy for her right IJ thrombus .
She was also started on Augmentin for her acute otitis media and vancomycin was added to her Flagyl because her C. diff toxins were persistently positive .
At the time of discharge , she is doing significantly better .
She is in good spirits .
She no longer complains of ear pain .
She breathes comfortably on 40% humidified oxygen trach mask .
She has been up to sitting at the side of the bed with physical therapy and occupational therapy .
She can tolerate approximately 15 minutes of activity at a time .
Speech Therapy has also seen her and fitted her with a Passy-Muir valve , which thus far she is tolerating .
Since the time of admission , she has had persistently elevated liver function enzymes , as well as an elevated amylase .
However , her lipase level has been normal .
The day prior to discharge , she did have a right upper quadrant ultrasound , which demonstrated findings consistent with the patient who is post cholecystectomy .
No intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation .
Some extrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation and continued presence of a large pancreatic pseudocyst .
The pancreas and liver , otherwise , appeared normal .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
1. Coronary artery disease .
Status post five - vessel stenting in **DATE[Aug] of 2006 .
2. Hypertension .
3. Hyperlipidemia .
4. Diabetes mellitus type 2 , prior to hospital admission , controlled with diet and medications .
5. COPD / emphysema .
6. Status post cholecystectomy .
7. Status post hysterectomy .
8. Class I obesity .
9. Since hospital admission has developed new diagnosis of pancreatitis with pancreatic pseudocyst formation resulting in gastric outlet obstruction .
10. History of Pseudomonas pneumonia .
11. History of gastric ileus .
12. History of C. difficile diarrhea .
13. MRSA .
14. VRE .
15. Ascites requiring paracentesis .
16. Thrombocytopenia .
17. Right IJ thrombus .
