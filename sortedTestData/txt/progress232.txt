EVALUATION DATE :
**DATE[Apr 25 07]
This patient remains in the ICU .
I continue to see her today , on **DATE[Apr 25 2007] , because of ongoing respiratory failure , failure to thrive , failure to wean , and now acute drop in hemoglobin .
This patient is anticoagulated for a DVT of her upper extremity and because of the drop in hemoglobin , it is likely that we need to rule out a possible retroperitoneal bleed .
She also showed abdominal pain that has increased and abdominal distension , so to date she was sent down for a CT of the chest and abdomen to rule out pneumonia , to rule out a retroperitoneal bleed , and to rule out intra - abdominal abscesses .
The patient , however , developed an episode of SVT at the CT and had to be brought back to the ICU .
The CT could not be completed .
When the patient came to the ICU , her blood pressure was 75/40 .
She received a bolus of fluid and remained 80/40 with a heart rate of 170 .
Therefore , I elected to cardiovert this patient .
This was done at once with a 100 joule discharge and the patient returned to normal sinus rhythm immediately after the cardioversion with a blood pressure that was 130/80 .
The patient will remain in the ICU for the time being .
We will continue mild diuresis .
We will wait until she is more stable to obtain the CT imaging that we were needing to rule out the evidence of the possibility of sepsis .
We continued to monitor her white count , which is now 24 down from 30 and she is now being covered empirically on antibiotics .
I , Dr. **NAME[XXX] , examined this patient for 33 minutes for a 99291 .
This is excluding the time that I performed a cardioversion for supraventricular tachycardia .
