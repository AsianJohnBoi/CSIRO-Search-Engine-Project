8.2 .
Given the patient 's recent history of LGIB / hemorrhoids and diverticulosis , and a lack of large drop in H/H , this was believed to be a self - limited diverticular bleed .
Given a recent h/o an NSTEMI , the patient was typed and crossed , received 1 unit of PRBC .
On the day of dishcarge , H&amp ; H were 9.6 &amp ; 28.6 , significantly higher than the day of admission .
