Mrs. **NAME[AAA] is a **AGE[in 60s]- year - old woman status post lung volume reduction surgery .
She continues to require critical care for management of respiratory failure , hyperglycemia , adrenal insufficiency , and hyponatremia .
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN :
1. PULMONARY :
Respiratory failure following double lung transplantation .
I am currently maintaining Mrs. **NAME[AAA] on assist - control ventilation , rate of 20 , tidal volume of 400 , 40% Fi02 and 5 of PEEP .
I will attempt a trach mask trial this morning and wean her Fi02 to maintain her oxygen saturation of greater than 88 to 90 .
Chest x-ray shows bibasilar atelectasis .
Breath sounds are distant and diminished in both bases and unchanged from previous examinations .
2. CARDIOVASCULAR :
Extremities are warm and adequately perfused .
She is in a sinus rhythm in the 80s to 90s .
Mean arterial pressure is in the 70s .
She is not requiring pressors at this time .
3. ENDOCRINE / HYPERGLYCEMIA :
I will continue sliding scale insulin coverage to maintain euglycemic control .
At this point I feel that she is likely adrenally insufficient and we will start her on stress - dose steroids and Florinef today .
I will resume her prednisone this morning .
4. INFECTIOUS DISEASE :
Afebrile overnight with a white count of 14.8 .
There have been no positive cultures .
She does not appear to be infected at this time .
5. FLUIDS , ELECTROLYTES AND NUTRITION :
Sodium 128 , potassium 5.5 , and magnesium 2.1 .
I will recheck a sodium again this afternoon and check urine electrolytes and osmolality .
6. RENAL :
Urinary output is marginal , but acceptable with a BUN of 29 and a creatinine of 1.6 .
She has minimal edema at this time .
I will continue to hydrate her with normal saline .
7. HEMATOLOGY :
Hemoglobin this morning is 9.5 with a platelet count of 277 and INR of 1.7 .
I will continue Coumadin due to a DVT .
8. GI :
Abdomen is soft and mildly tender .
There has been a question of cholecystitis in the past and we will obtain a repeat right upper quadrant ultrasound today .
9. PROPHYLAXIS :
I will continue Coumadin due to lower extremity DVT and head of the bed elevation and resume GI prophylaxis .
Critical care time = 32 minutes .
