ADMISSION DATE :

EVALUATION DATE :
**DATE[Mar 20 07]
I saw the patient on rounds with the ICU team .
I interviewed and examined the patient at the bedside .
I reviewed her data on EMTEK including vital signs , Is&amp ; O s , laboratory data and medication list .
I discussed the management plan with the critical care team after reviewing the house staff note .
The patient is a **AGE[in 60s]- year - old female admitted on **DATE[Feb 12 2007] with sternal infection or sternitis status post debridement with ongoing issues of respiratory failure , renal failure , and previous CABG for coronary artery disease .
She has also had bilateral effusions and is status post drainage .
Overnight , there were no acute events ; however , her tube feeds are being held because of some nausea that the patient has been complaining of persistently .
Heart rate has been in the 50s to low 70s , with mean arterial pressure in the 70s to 100 range .
She is on assist control ventilation , breathing 12 to 20 , and peak pressures in the 30s .
Chest tube or pigtail has drained 550 mL .
Blood sugars range from the 70s to 143 .
Her tube feeds are currently held .
She did have hemodialysis the previous day with ultrafiltration greater than 800 mL , with BUN and creatinine now decreased to 84 from 110 and her creatinine down to 3.2 .
Her chest x-ray per my read shows diminished left - sided effusion .
The patient was complaining of generalized abdominal pain , although I could not elicit any further details , and she was complaining of nausea .
She has rhonchi on her chest examination .
She was somewhat bradycardic .
Her chest wall has some tenderness around the tube site ; however , there was no evidence of any infection associated with this .
Her abdomen is soft and diffusely tender but without any guarding .
She was following simple commands and answering simple yes / no questions .
She is on Lopressor , Pepcid , insulin drip , vancomycin day #26 out of #42 , cefepime day #26 out of #42 , and subcutaneous heparin .
We will try some CPAP pressure support spontaneous breathing trials today .
Because of her bradycardia , I am discontinuing the patient 's Lopressor , which has periodically been held anyhow .
From a renal standpoint , she is due to undergo hemodialysis today .
We will keep an eye on her pleural effusions .
If they do not respond to the extraction of fluid , she may require pigtail drainage again .
From a GI / nutrition standpoint , it is unclear the source of her nausea and this may be secondary to azotemia .
I am resuming her tube feeds at 20 mL per hour , but after checking some abdominal labs including amylase , lipase , bilirubin and LFT s .
I am continuing her antibiotics to finish a 42 - day course for her sternitis per Infectious Disease .
She is on subcutaneous heparin for DVT prophylaxis and Pepcid for GI prophylaxis .
Critical care time is 31 minutes .
