EVALUATION DATE :
**DATE[Feb 30 07]
Mr. **NAME[AAA] is a **AGE[in 70s]- year - old gentleman who we were consulted and saw yesterday for kidney dysfunction .
We recommended that he be given some Lasix .
With the Lasix , he made about 2.5 liters of urine over 24 hours .
He feels considerably better today with less shortness of breath ; however , he did tell us that he had to sleep sitting up because he was afraid to lie down because of shortness of breath .
He seems to have no chest pain .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
On physical examination , he was in considerably less respiratory distress than yesterday , but he was certainly sitting up .
On examination of his lungs , he still has some rales at the bases bilaterally .
Rhythm is regular .
Abdomen is distended and nontender .
He continues to have considerable lower extremity edema .
LABORATORY DATA :
Laboratory work was all inspected .
His creatinine today is 3.1 .
It was 3.0 yesterday .
BUN is 52 , 47 yesterday .
Potassium is 4.4 .
Hematocrit is 23.5 .
IMPRESSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS :
Mr. **NAME[AAA] appears to have considerable chronic kidney disease and has considerable volume overload .
I would continue with the Lasix 80 mg at least once a day , possibly b.i.d. , to get him out of congestive heart failure .
Perhaps some consideration should be given to giving him 1 unit of packed RBCs .
If you do this , I would suggest giving this with some additional IV Lasix .
The Renal Service will continue to follow him .
Thank you for this consult .
