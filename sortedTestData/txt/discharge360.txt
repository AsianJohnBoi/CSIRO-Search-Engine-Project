CONSULTATIONS :
By Dr. **NAME[WWW] with Cardiology and Dr. **NAME[VVV] with Pulmonary .
DIAGNOSTIC TESTING :
Included an echocardiogram which revealed an EF of 65% , asymmetric septal hypertrophy with good systolic function and evidence of diastolic dysfunction without a left ventricular outflow tract gradient , mild
TR , mitral annular calcification , a small pericardial effusion , and moderate pulmonary hypertension .
No change from prior echocardiogram was seen .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient is a **AGE[in 70s]- year - old man who presented to the emergency room with complaints of shortness of breath .
He had an EKG which revealed atrial fibrillation and nonspecific ST changes .
He ruled out for an MI by his troponin criteria .
His echocardiogram as reported above was no change from a prior echocardiogram .
He had a catheterization performed in **DATE[Aug 2006] , which revealed minimal coronary disease with stenosis of only 25% to 30% in his three main coronary arteries .
He was seen by Dr. **NAME[WWW] that time , and Dr. **NAME[WWW] was consulted during this admission .
He was found to have a BNP of 748 , but his chest x-ray was clear .
This was thought to be secondary to some mild congestive heart failure , maybe secondary to diastolic dysfunction which was also revealed in his echocardiogram .
His INR was therapeutic at 2 .
However , he was given a dose of vitamin K by Cardiology in the thought that he might have another catheterization .
Pulmonary was also consulted again .
Although , he did have pulmonary function test series and a CT scan with contrast in his **DATE[Aug 2006] admission offer the same diagnosis , both of these tests were unrevealing in the sense that he had no significant pulmonary disease .
He had some mild interstitial changes on his PFT s .
Pulmonary felt that this was all cardiogenic in the sense that he had an elevated BNP and an echocardiogram with diastolic dysfunction .
The patient was diuresed , and his O2 saturations remained stable without oxygen .
A pulse oximetry test with exercise was to be performed on the day of discharge .
His INR was subtherapeutic on discharge .
Cardiology felt that it was safe for him to be discharged to home .
He will be discharged on another 5 - mg tablet of Coumadin for today .
He received two days of 5 mg and one day of 10 mg prior to discharge .
He may require some extra dosing still given that he was given 10 mg of vitamin K prior to his discharge .
His usual dose of Coumadin is only 2.5 mg of Coumadin with 2 days of 5 mg of Coumadin .
He will follow up in the office within a week and have a PT and INR the next day after discharge .
