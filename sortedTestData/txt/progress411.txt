I personally managed Mr. **NAME[AAA] in the ICU .
He is a **AGE[in 60s]- year - old man with a history of stroke and brain edema , who is now somewhat improved following his 3% sodium chloride , which we have discontinued today .
He continues to be febrile .
He is day six on Unasyn .
He also seems to have more infiltrates than he has in the recent past .
His white count , however , is on a decreasing trend , so because of his increasing infiltrates and the fact that he is still febrile , we have changed his antibiotic today to cefepime and Flagyl and will see if this improves his pulmonary situation .
It may very well be that he continues to subclinically aspirate as he does not have a very good gag reflex .
Will have to continue to evaluate this on a daily basis .
He is on nasal cannula .
His oxygen saturation is good .
We have discontinued his arterial line .
His sodium is acceptable at 149 .
He passes air reasonably well both sides of the chest .
Heart is regular rhythm .
Abdomen is soft .
He puts out adequate amounts or urine .
Blood pressure has been somewhat elevated .
We have increased his lisinopril .
He is out of bed in a chair .
Occupational therapy and physical therapy are continuing to follow him .
We are continuing to watch him expectantly and supportively .
Critical care time 30 minutes .
