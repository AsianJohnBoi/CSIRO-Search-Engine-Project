I am currently seeing this **AGE[in 50s]- year - old patient status post bilateral lung reduction surgery .
Her intraoperative course was complicated with tracheal tear , subsequent respiratory failure , and renal failure , now pneumonia and hemodynamic instability with anemia .
I examined her and reviewed her laboratory data , chart data , and chest x-ray .
Hemodynamically , she did require to go back on some norepinephrine .
She did drop her blood pressure .
She got 1.9 liters off under ultrafiltration on hemodialysis yesterday .
The other thing that I think is contributing to her hypotension is her anemia in which she has dropped her hematocrit over the course of last night and this morning again .
So at this point in time , she got a liter of Hextend .
She is getting a unit of packed RBC s .
Her hematocrit this morning was down from 26 to 23 .
At this point in time , her Levophed requirements are now down to half of what they were at 0.028 mcg / kg / minute .
We will try to wean the Levophed off as she tolerates .
From a respiratory standpoint , she clinically looks pretty decent this morning .
She is on trach mask trials and clinically looks good .
Saturations are a little bit lower than what they had been yesterday , down around the low 90s , but her respiratory status appears to be fairly comfortable on a trach mask weaning trial , so we will leave her on trach mask as long as she tolerates it .
From an ID standpoint , her sputum actually came back growing Klebsiella .
I did send off a formal blind BAL on her and it had moderate Gram - negative rods .
This is likely going to be the Klebsiella as well .
Her white count is normal .
She is afebrile .
She is weaning from the vent and my concern is that she indeed may have at least a bronchitis and in light of her previous tracheal tear and her respiratory status and lung status , I think it is probably reasonable to go ahead and treat her for a seven - day course with cefepime which the organism is sensitive to .
Otherwise , I have also added some p.o. Flagyl for C. diff. prophylaxis as well .
She is on enteral nutritional support which she is tolerating .
As previously mentioned , she is anemic .
Hematocrit is down to 23 over the course of last night and this morning .
She is getting a unit of packed RBC s and we will follow her hematocrit closely again .
So in light of this , we will continue to hold her subcu heparin .
GI has been consulted .
The only possible source I think at this point in time is likely going to be GI .
We will guaiac her stool and send it for occult blood when she has a bowel movement .
From a renal electrolyte standpoint , she was dialyzed yesterday .
Decent clearance .
BUN and creatinine are 30 / 1.7 from yesterday .
Potassium is normal now .
It was 5.6 yesterday .
I think it is probably reasonable that she going to get a tunnel dialysis catheter , so we will try to plan to get it for Tuesday on her off day from dialysis and then go from there .
I think at this point in time she does not really need to go on Prisma .
We just have to be cautious of how much fluid we take off of her , especially in the setting of dropping hematocrit .
Otherwise , at this point in time we will check her hematocrit closely with GI Medicine 's input .
Otherwise , we will continue to wean her Levophed as tolerates .
Continue trach mask as she tolerates .
She is on GI prophylaxis .
Critical care time equals 34 minutes .
