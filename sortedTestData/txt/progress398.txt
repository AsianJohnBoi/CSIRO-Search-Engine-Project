I am managing this critically ill **AGE[in 70s]- year - old male who is status post laparotomy and mesh removal for infected abdominal wounds .
His postoperative course has been complicated by a leak and an enterocutaneous fistula status post repair and subsequent skin closure .
His hospital course is now complicated by respiratory insufficiency , delirium and hypertension .
I am seeing him for management of these issues .
I have seen and examined the patient , reviewed his laboratory , radiographic and EMTEK data , and discussed the management with the general surgeons .
PROBLEMS AND MANAGEMENT :
1. Status post mesh removal :
White blood cell count is up today to 26,000 with a slight left shift and a low - grade fever .
The source of the possible infection is not clear .
There are some streaky bilateral lower lobe infiltrates on the right greater than left .
Abdominal abscess is also a significant concern .
He remains empirically on Zosyn and vancomycin .
His last vancomycin trough was 13.7 and I have increased his dosing to q.8 hourly .
2. Delirium :
He remains somewhat agitated but is under better control with the Haldol .
I have increased the frequency of the Haldol today for better control .
3. Hypertension :
He has a history of ischemic heart disease and peripheral vascular disease .
He has been hypertensive and tachycardic .
Given his past medical history , I think it is important that we get his blood pressure and heart rate under control .
I started him on a labetalol infusion which I am titrating to get his heart rate less than 80 .
Mean arterial pressures have been under significantly better control on the labetalol drip .
4. ICU prophylaxis :
He has had a resumption of bowel function today and we will start trickle feeds tomorrow .
He has stress - ulcer and DVT prophylaxis .
He is mildly hypernatremic and I have changed his IV fluid to D5 / water today .
Total critical care time = 40 minutes .
