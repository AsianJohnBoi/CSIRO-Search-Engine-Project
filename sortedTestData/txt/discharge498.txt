4. Ortho - Spine with Dr. **NAME[PPP] .
STUDIES COMPLETED :
1. On **DATE[Sep 18 2007] , chest x-ray showing no obvious acute air space opacity , cardiomegaly , and multiple old pacer wires and hardware , interval removal of PICC line .
2. On **DATE[Sep 19 2007] , x-ray of the lumbar spine showing status post spinal fusion of L2-L3 levels , the hardware is intact and in satisfactory position , essentially no interval change from the previous study .
3. On **DATE[Sep 20 2007] , x-ray of the right elbow showing soft - tissue swelling and calcifications typical of olecranon bursitis .
4. On **DATE[Sep 19 2007] , CT of the lumbosacral spine showing prior surgical changes including laminectomies of L2-L5 , pedicle screws in L2-L3 , interbody fusion at L2-L3 , degenerative disk space narrowing at L2-L3 , no evidence of abscess or osteomyelitis .
5. On **DATE[Sep 22 2007] , transthoracic echocardiogram showing a technically difficult study , primarily parasternal views , nondilated left ventricle with hypokinetic inferior septum and inferior wall and mild to moderately decreased systolic function , mild tricuspid regurgitation , catheter seen in the right heart consistent with pacemaker , a defibrillator , no vegetation seen by this technique .
As compared to **DATE[Dec 14 2004] , left ventricular systolic function has mildly decreased , right ventricular leads are new .
6. On **DATE[Sep 24 2007] , CT scan of the right upper extremity shows extremely limited evaluation in the right elbow due to streak artifact from adjacent pacer .
If clinical concern persists for abscess of this region , repeat imaging with the patient 's arm above his head is recommended .
No definite findings of abscess within the right arm or proximal forearm within the significant limitations of the study as described .
7. On **DATE[Sep 26 2007] , status post PICC line placement .
Mr. **NAME[AAA] is a **AGE[in 60s]- year - old , African - American male who presented to the emergency department on **DATE[Sep 18 2007] complaining of fevers , generalized malaise and fatigue .
He has an extensive past medical history most recently including status post multiple back surgeries , the last one being in **DATE[Jul 2007] and then being discharged from South Side Rehabilitation on **DATE[Sep 03 2007] .
During that hospital stay , he was treated for a URI with a seven - day course of Cipro which was completed on **DATE[Sep 09 2007] .
Past medical history also includes insulin - dependent diabetes , glaucoma , history of DVT and PE on Coumadin , ischemic colitis , sarcoidosis with cardiac involvement , status post AICD , GERD , hyperlipidemia , hypertension , BPH , and recurrent MSSA .
He stated that after he was discharged from **INSTITUTION Rehabilitation , he had a couple of good days , but then developed fever as high as 101.4 , chills , and generalized malaise .
He denied any cough , chest pain , abdominal pain , nausea , vomiting , shortness of breath , hematuria , or dysuria .
The most recent laboratory data on **DATE[Sep 25 2007] showed a sodium of 139 , potassium 4 , chloride 105 , CO2 of 25 , BUN 13 , creatinine 0.9 , glucose 147 , and he had two negative troponins .
White count 9.3 , hemoglobin 14.3 , hematocrit 42.2 , platelet count 341,000 .
INR from **DATE[Sep 26 2007] is 2.1 .
Vancomycin trough on **DATE[Sep 21 2007] was 5.5 .
Blood culture on **DATE[Sep 21 2007] was negative times five days .
Prior blood cultures grew Staphylococcus aureus .
Urine culture was contaminated .
Nose culture was positive for MRSA .
In regards to his fever , we had several services involved .
Initial workup included blood cultures , urine culture and chest x-ray .
His blood cultures grew right away with Staphylococcus aureus .
Since he had had recent back surgery , we were concerned that he could have hardware infection .
He was seen by Ortho-Spine with Dr. **NAME[PPP] and x-rays of his lumbar spine as well as CT scan of his lumbar spine were completed .
After Dr. **NAME[PPP] reviewed the scans , it was his assessment that it is highly unlikely that there was any infection of the spine .
Mr. **NAME[AAA] did complain of some right elbow pain and did have an area of erythema , swelling , and tenderness .
We were concerned that possibly he had a cellulitis and / or an abscess that was causing this recurrent bacteremia .
At this point , we had Orthopedic Surgery involved .
We did check a CT scan of the elbow which was quite limited in views as Mr. **NAME[AAA] would not raise his elbow over his head .
The views that were obtained did not show any definite abscess .
They only recommended keeping his arm in a sling and following up as an outpatient .
Other possible etiologies we entertained was possible endocarditis or infection of his pacemaker .
We did get a transthoracic echocardiogram that did not show any vegetations from that technique .
We did not pursue a transesophageal echocardiogram as we did not think that his treatment plan would change .
He was followed by Dr. **NAME[QQQ] of Infectious Disease .
Initially on his hospitalization , he was on gentamicin and vancomycin .
However , it was Dr. **NAME[QQQ] 's final recommendation that he should be on nafcillin 2 grams IV q. 4 hours for a total of six weeks starting with the day of his last negative blood cultures .
Therefore , he will remain on IV antibiotics through **DATE[Nov 03 2007] .
At this point in time , the plan after nafcillin is that he will be on oral Keflex for an additional six weeks .
Dr. **NAME[QQQ] will follow the patient while over at South Side Rehabilitation .
Since we still do not have a clear etiology as to why he has recurrent bacteremia , we have scheduled for a tagged white blood cell scan on **DATE[Oct 01 2007] at **INSTITUTION Radiology Department at 10:00 a.m.
He is to take his prescription with him at the time of the appointment .
He has a history of DVT / PE in the past .
He had been on a steady Coumadin dose of 5 mg every day , except Wednesdays 2.5 mg .
We kept him on this dose while inhouse , but his INR jumped from 2.2 to 7.2 over the course of two days .
We held his Coumadin dose on **DATE[Sep 24 2007] and **DATE[Sep 25 2007] .
On **DATE[Sep 26 2007] , his INR was done to 2.1 and we will resume his usual doses .
We think he probably spiked secondary to drug interaction with his antibiotics .
I would recommend daily INR checks .
His blood sugars were kept under control while inhouse .
We continued him on his q. day Lantus dose and a low - dose sliding scale insulin with Lispro insulin .
On the day of his transfer , he had a PICC line placed and overall is feeling a bit better .
He does complain of intermittent nausea with infusion of his antibiotics .
