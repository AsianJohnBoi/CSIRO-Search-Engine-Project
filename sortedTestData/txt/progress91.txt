Summary of Hospitalization :
**AGE[in 70s] yo veteran with no significant cardiac history ( last echo 2003 with LVEF 55% ) , but with CRI , HTN , PVD , and h/o stroke ( 4 yrs. ago ) who presented **DATE[Feb 17 07] with 4 days of lightheadedness ( not vertigo ) , nausea ( no emesis ) , poor appetite , fatigue , and ~ 2 brief episodes of chest pain 4 days prior : L substernal , non-radiating , 5/10 , no associated symptoms , lasting ~ 2minutes .
Patient denied any pre - or syncopal episodes , denied palpitations , noted SOB only the morning of presentation while walking to the bathroom , denied recent fevers / chills .
Did report ongoing urinary incontinence and frequency , though no dysuria .
Initially presented to VA ED ( where he seeks all medical treatment ) , where he was found to be in a junctional rhythm .
First troponin was negative .
Transferred to the **INSTITUTION ED where vitals were :
T 36.7 , HR 40 ( still junctional ) , BP 122/61 , RR 18 ; was given ASA 81 mg x4 tabs , Nitro Paste 1 " and then admitted to the Cardiac Pavilion service .
Initial hospital course in the Cardiac Pavilion was as follows :
CVS
Within a few hrs. of admission , heart rate spontaneously converted to normal sinus rhythm , but continued to be bradycardic .
The bradycardia was thought to be due to medications in the setting of acute on chronic renal failure , so beta blocker ( atenolol ) was discontinued .
HCTZ was also discontinued due to elevated Cr .
For HTN patient was started on Norvasc 10 mg daily on 1/18 .
Troponins were negative x3 .
Systolic blood pressure was in the 150 's .
Renal
Admission Cr was 5.2 ( baseline 2.0-2.5 ) , showing acute on chronic renal insufficiency .
Urine lytes were suggestive of a pre-renal etiology ( consistent with recent decreased po intake ) , and IVF were initiated on 1/18 : NS @ 100 cc / hr .
Cr began to recover .
In addition , for metabolic acidosis , Na-bicarbonate was started on 1/18 ( low bicarb on admission ) .
On **DATE[Feb 19 07] patient was stable from a cardiac standpoint , Cr continued to improve with IVF , BP control was maintained with Norvasc , and the patient was transferred to the General Medicine A Service .
Hospital Course continued :
CVS
Blood pressure became quite high with systolic pressures in the 170s to 180s .
He was on a maximum dose of Norvasc , and hydralazine was added q.i.d. as well as a clonidine patch of 0.2 mg achieving systolic blood pressures of less than 140s .
On 1/22 tachycardia ( 100-110 ) was noted , but the patient continued to maintain good SaO2 on room air until 1/25 , at which time troponin was drawn and found to be elevated at 1.49 ( had been negative x3 on admission 1 week prior ).
The Cardiology consult service evaluated the patient and recommended giving a dosage of IV lasix x1 , holding IVF , start heparin empirically , and check TTE ( last assessment of LVEF was 55% in 2003 ) .
Decision was made to transfer patient back to Cardiac Pavilion for closer monitoring on telemetry .
Renal
NS IVF was continued until 1/23 and Cr continued to improve to around the baseline of 2.5 .
The renal U/S was done showing no hydronephrosis , and the right kidney measured 10.2 cm , while the left kidney measured 9.9 cm.
Na - bicarboante was continued throughout .
Respiratory
On 1/24 patient was notably tachypneic with SaO2 90-94% at rest , and also found to have significant edema of RUE at the site of earlier peripheral IV .
In the setting of tachypnea , tachycardia , decreased SaO2 , lowgrade fevers , and RUE edema , suspicion for a PE was high .
Bilateral upper extremity doppler study was negative for DVT and a CT scan of RUE showed dependent edema ; a VQ scan was obtained 1/24 with low probability for PE .
By 1/25 patient continued to have dyspnea and tachypnea at rest and required supplemental O2 , with SaO2 97% on 3L via nasal canula .
CXR was repeated and found to have no signs of infiltrate , and scant pulmonary congestion .
ID
Patient developed intermittent low - grade temperatures with no obvious etiology ; Tm 1/20 of 38 Tm 1/23 38.5 .
A CXR was done on 1/23 showing clear lungs with minimal fluid at the right base .
A U/A was done which was within normal limits ( nitrite , LE negative ; no bacteria ).
Urine and blood cultures from 1/23 were with no growth .
The patient denied any subjective symptoms such as chills , cough , or dysuria .
Again on 1/25 Tm was 38.1 .
Heme
Admission Hgb was 11.1 , and 1 week later it has trended down to 10.1 with a normal MCV .
Access
Left brachial PICC line placed 1/25 .
PM&amp ; R / PT / OT
Patient was assessed by PM&amp ; R service 1/21 who felt he did not need inpatient Rehab , and recommended a discharge to home with 24 - hr supervision with home PT / OT and nursing .
Prophylaxis / Diet
Maintained on colace , senna , and H2 blocker .
Renal / cardiac diet .
Upon transfer to Pavilion 1/25 :

Gen : labored breathing , but not in acute distress
HEENT :

Neck :

Resp : clear but with poor air movement diffusely
CVS :

Abdo :

Extr :
++ b/l pitting edema to mid - calf ; no calf tenderness ; LUE PICC in place
Assessment and Plan :
**AGE[in 70s] yo WM who presented initially 1 week ago with symptomatic junctional bradycardia and acute on chronic renal insufficiency .
Since then he has developed tachycardia , tachypnea , and a new O2 requirement , also with newly elevated troponin , but no new EKG changes .
CVS
a ) r/o ACS
- cycle troponins :
1.49 --&gt ; 1.16 ; now trending down
- EKG tonight showed NSR @ 95 bpm , normal axis , normal PR interval and QRS duration , no Q-waves , no ST / T changes , no T wave inversion ; no change from previous
- continue ASA and zocor
- will repeat EKG in am
b ) evaluate for Left heart failure
- will obtain TTE ( last echo was 2003 with normal EF )
- will check BNP
- gentle diuresis , though lungs sound and look relatively clear
c ) HTN
- continue Norvasc 10 mg , clonidine patch 0.2 mg , hydralazine 10 mg q6hr , metoprolol 25 mg bid ( no longer bradycardic )
d ) claudication
- continue pletal
RESP
a ) r/o PE
- VQ with low probability ; UE dopplers negative
- will get LE dopplers ( patient has been mostly in bed &gt ; 1 - week )
- will start heparin gtt empirically
- will check ABG to eval A-a gradient
- reluctant to obtain high - res .
CT due to renal insuffcy .
and IV contrast
b ) poor aeration
- tried xopenex / atrovent nebulizer x1 with good effect ; will continue q4hr for now
- titrate O2 to SaO2&gt; /= 94%
RENAL
- will monitor Cr closely especially now that patient has received Lasix 20 mg IV x1
- continue Na - bicarb
GI
- will obtain stool guaiac
- continue pepcid , colace , senna
Heme
- will evaluate for Fe defcy anemia , B12 , retic count
- stool guaiac
Uro
- continue Hytrin
Rheum
- continue allopurinol
ID
- will monitor for recurrent low - grade fevers ; no infectious etiology identified thus far ; WBC wnl ; fevers could be due to underlying ? PE
FENP
- renal / cardiac diet
CODE
- patient wishes to be FULL code
