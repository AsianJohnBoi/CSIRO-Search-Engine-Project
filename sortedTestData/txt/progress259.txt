**DATE[Jun 09 07]
The patient is a **AGE[in 20s]- year - old woman I am caring for in the ICU for atelectasis .
I reviewed this patient 's history , talked to the nurse .
The patient was hemodynamically stable , was reading and conversing well with her relative , and therefore , I felt this patient , from an ICU standpoint , could most likely safely leave the ICU today .
I did note her chest x-ray looked like she had some right lower lobe atelectasis / collapse , and therefore , ordered that more aggressive pulmonary toilette be done for her right lung .
THIS IS A MODERATE LEVEL VISIT ON AN ESTABLISHED PATIENT .
