**INSTITUTION COURSE :
Mrs. **NAME[AAA] is a **AGE[in 70s]- year - old female who initially was admitted as a transfer from **INSTITUTION for evaluation of changed mental status and because she is a patient of **INSTITUTION and she has always been taken care of in **INSTITUTION .
At admission , the patient was disoriented and had mental status changes and is a poor historian .
According to her live-in caregiver , the patient has reportedly become more confused during the two days prior to this admission .
The caregiver denied the patient has a fever , sweats , or chills .
The caregiver noticed that the patient has had frequent urination during the past couple of days .
**INSTITUTION , a CT had been performed and a urinalysis and a culture also has been sent out .
From the urinalysis , she was gram-positive cocci .
That CT scan shows no acute intracranial hemorrhage .
The patient had been given Cipro for her UTI and also the patient was given Pepcid for some other GI symptoms .
Upon the patient 's transfer to **INSTITUTION , her mental status is getting worse .
She has more confusion and also developed some delirium and hallucinations .
Upon review of her medications , we took her off Cipro and Pepcid and put her on Macrobid for her UTI .
We also found that her eyes were red and dry and have fluent discharge and so the eye purulent discharge has been sent for culture and also urine has been sent in for culture again and when the results came back the patient was found to have MRSA in her eye discharge and also has a MRSA infection in her urine , 100,000 colonies in the culture .
The patient has been maintained with no fever and no white count elevation .

In the meanwhile , we will get a history from her caregiver .
The patient had eyelid and eye tear duct surgery done before in **INSTITUTION .
An ophthalmologist has been consulted .
Polysporin was given for her eye instead of gentamicin per the ophthalmologist .
For the patient 's mental status , we are treating her infection .
Meanwhile , we consulted Psychiatry and a neurologist .
Neurology reviewed her CT scan and assessment after review of her CT scan was no further imaging necessary per the neurologist .
The psychiatry consultant recommended the patient has baseline dementia and basically to treat the infection and correct her dehydration and electrolyte imbalance .

With rehydration and treating her infections in the urine tract and in her eye , Mrs. **NAME[AAA] 's mental status is getting better with treating her infections and correcting her dehydration and electrolyte imbalance .
