The patient has been stable overnight .
Does not have any nausea or vomiting .
He has some pruritus , has not had any hematemesis or melena .

Liver function tests were elevated .

He has cholestatic picture with elevated bilirubin of 21.6 today .
I have reviewed Hepatology notes , and I concur with the diagnosis of alcoholic hepatitis .
I have explained to the patient the need for stopping alcohol .
The patient , I believe , understands the consequence of continued drinking .
I would prefer to send him to an **INSTITUTION , but this is not clear whether that is possible since he has recently been in the
Alcohol Rehab Facilities .
The patient is not sure whether he is going to stop drinking .
I recommended that he do .
At this time , we plan to discharge him .
He wants to go home .
He will have follow up with his primary physician .
