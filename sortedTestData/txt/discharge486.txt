REASON FOR ADMISSION :
**NAME[BBB AAA] is a **AGE[90+]- year - old female with a history of hypertension , who presented via paramedics with generalized weakness and decline in mental status .
She is living at home independently and was looked after by a neighbor who had noticed significant decline in her ability to take care of herself over the last several days .
1. Failure to thrive .
Initially , the patient presented , a CT was obtained , as well as an MRI to rule out any acute neurological abnormality that could account for her sudden decline .
However , this test did not reveal any significant explanations for her decline .
The patient was rehydrated with IV fluids .
An EEG was also obtained to rule out any seizure activities .
This was also negative .
2. UTI .
The patient initially presented and had a weakly positive urinalysis , which cultured out E. coli that was pan - sensitive .
The patient was treated with IV Cipro and a repeat urine culture was negative .
3. Hypertension .
Her pressure continues to be elevated throughout the course .
When she initially presented it was really elevated .
This was thought to be secondary to noncompliance with her medication and her mental status had prevented her from taking her prescribed medications .
Therefore , some adjustments were made in her meds including an increase in her lisinopril , as well as atenolol .
She is being discharged on lisinopril 30 daily , atenolol 50 mg b.i.d. , as well as nifedipine 10 mg p.o. t.i.d.
4. Diabetes .
Her sugars were initially varied from 300s down to the 100s .
She initially came in on Amaryl .
This was stopped and the patient was maintained on Lantus q.p.m. as well as a sliding scale .
Her sugars tended to balance out after that was initiated .
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS :
1. Duonebs 3 mL aerosolized t.i.d. and q. 2 hours p.r.n.
2. Atenolol 50 mg p.o. daily .
