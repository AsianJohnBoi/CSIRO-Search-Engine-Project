The patient will be discharged home on a regular diet , activity as tolerated .
The patient will follow up with Dr. **NAME[VVV UUU] on **DATE[Dec 5 2007] , at 11:30 a.m. at **INSTITUTION ; telephone number **PHONE .
She will follow up with her primary care physician within 1-2 weeks or as needed .
Post - discharge testing will include BMP and magnesium on **DATE[Dec 5 2007] , for followup of her magnesium level .
FINAL DIAGNOSIS :
1. Advanced - stage cervical cancer , status post loop ileostomy and suprapubic catheterization .
2. Squamous cell carcinoma in the presacral area .
3. Bipolar disorder .
4. Schizophrenia .
5. Chronic abdominal pain .
OPERATIONS AND PROCEDURE :
CT scan of the abdomen which showed increase in the size of the presacral mass at the posterior aspect of the pelvis , with an area of relative radiolucency within the mass , suggesting an area of necrosis .
This CT scan was compared with the CT scan done on **DATE[Oct 2 2007] .
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS :
1. Percocet 5/325 mg p.o. q.6 hours p.r.n.
2. MS Contin CR 15 mg p.o. b.i.d.
3. Cymbalta 60 mg p.o. daily .
4. Pepcid 20 mg p.o. b.i.d.
5. Magnesium oxide 400 mg p.o. t.i.d.
The dose will be adjusted on followup after the level of magnesium is documented .
6. Nicotine patch daily .
7. K-Dur 20 mEq p.o. b.i.d.
8. Sodium bicarbonate 650 mg p.o. daily .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient is a **AGE[in 30s]- year - old white female with history of metastatic cervical cancer who presented to the hospital with abdominal pain for 2 months .
The patient has advanced stage carcinoma , with a presacral mass which is most likely secondary to metastatic disease from the cervical cancer .
That has been causing her chronic abdominal pain .
The patient has undergone operations of the abdomen including radical hysterectomy , cystectomy with ileal conduit and ileostomy .
Over the last couple of months , the patient has been having severe abdominal pain at the ileostomy site , and she has been seeing several doctors for pain management .
The patient is somewhat manipulative and she is a very difficult patient to deal with .
After the patient had been admitted to the hospital , a CT scan of the abdomen was done which showed , as mentioned above , the presacral mass had increased in size and has developed some necrosis which could be the cause of increasing pain .
The patient has been receiving pain medications during her stay in the hospital , and since this cancer is in an advanced state , there is no other treatment to be offered to her except for palliative care .
Fine - needle aspiration of the presacral mass was done ; this showed atypical necrotic cells suspicious for squamous cell carcinoma .
The patient has been stable throughout her stay in the hospital except for a low serum magnesium level which was replaced accordingly .
A urine culture was sent ; this grew Escherichia coli ( ESBL ) and Enterococcus species , but since the patient has an ileal conduit , this may be contamination .
The patient was initially started on ciprofloxacin which was eventually discontinued because the organisms were resistant to ciprofloxacin .
The plan for her now is to manage her pain with pain medications , and to have her follow up with the oncologist at **INSTITUTION for further treatment .
We have already made an appointment for the patient with Dr. **NAME[VVV UUU] on Monday .
The patient was advised to be there on time .
On the day of discharge , the patient is stable and she can walk with a walker .
She may need some assistance at home .
She will go home and stay with her mother for now .
We asked the patient to follow up with her primary care physician as needed .
