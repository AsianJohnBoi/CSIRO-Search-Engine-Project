I personally interviewed and examined the patient this morning and discussed the case with the house staff team .
She is a **AGE[in 60s]- year - old woman with multiple medical problems who presented with an exacerbation of chronic abdominal pain felt seborrheic to spinal stenosis .
No new etiology for the pain has been found .
She has been controlled with IV pain medicines , and today , she feels better with the exception of symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux disease .
Specifically , her neck and back pain is better , but she required oral antacids in addition to her systemic proton pump inhibitors to relieve her symptoms of reflux .
Otherwise , she has no significant complaints although she does feel she is constipated and wishes to have some mild stool softeners .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
Her blood pressure and pulse are unremarkable and normal .
She is afebrile .
Her lungs show poor inspiratory effort but otherwise clear .
Her cardiac exam is unremarkable .
Her abdomen is soft .
She has good bowel sounds .
Once again , there is a discordance between tenderness elicited by palpation with hand versus the tenderness elicited by palpation with stethoscope .

Her potassium is low at 3.1 , chloride 112 , BUN and creatinine 3 and 0.5 , white blood cell count 10,100 , and hemoglobin and hematocrit 10.9 and 31 .
IMPRESSION :
1. Abdominal pain .
There is no obvious infectious or other pathologic reason for her abdominal pain .
She has nonspecific bowel gas pattern .
She has no evidence of obstruction and has been eating and advancing her diet as tolerated .
We will convert her IV pain medicines to oral and try to replicate what she had at home and move towards discharge .
