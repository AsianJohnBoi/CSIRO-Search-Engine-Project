ATTENDING PHYSICIAN :
**NAME[YYY M ZZZ]
ADMISSION DATE :
**DATE[Nov 18 2007]
EVALUATION DATE :
**DATE[Nov 20 07]
I personally examined the patient on **DATE[Nov 20 2007] .
I reviewed the consultation note from the Infectious Disease Service from **DATE[Nov 19 2007] .
I discussed the case with Dr. **NAME[VVV UUU] .
Please insert my note linked to Dr. **NAME[UUU] .
The patient feels fairly well this morning but did have fever up to 100.4 yesterday .
He had some fleeting right - sided back pain but that has completely resolved .
He denies headaches , cough , chest pain or dyspnea , abdominal pain , nausea , vomiting , diarrhea or constipation .
The patient has had several of the urine cultures positive for Candida and it is possible that this is a Candida bacteremia with possible abscess formation , then the perinephric fluid collection , or that he might have a bacterial abscess .
There is also the possibility that he might have ceded his pleural effusion at the suggestion of the Infectious Disease Service , we have stopped his Zosyn but continued him on intravenous fluconazole .
We will contact IR for drainage of the perinephric abscess and I would be inclined to also do a diagnostic thoracentesis at the same time .
The patient is comfortable today .
We will continue him on his present regimen .
