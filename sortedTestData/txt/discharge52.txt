HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
This is a **AGE[in 70s]- year - old male followed by Dr. **NAME[ZZZ] in our office with multiple medical problems as above , who was referred to the emergency department at **INSTITUTION .
He had been having intermittent symptoms of chest and abdominal pain over the preceding two weeks .
Initially he presented to **INSTITUTION with concern for possible acute coronary syndrome .
He was thought to have musculoskeletal pain and discharged with Darvocet .
Subsequent presentation at **INSTITUTION Emergency Department with colicky abdominal pain , thought to be related to cholelithiasis , and again discharged .
Dr. **NAME[ZZZ] obtained a CT scan of the chest and abdomen on **DATE[Jan 29 2008] , which did reveal a type B aortic dissection extending to the level of the celiac axis , with mesenteric and renal arteries patent .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit for evaluation and monitoring .
The decision was made to manage his type B aortic dissection conservatively .
Blood pressure was carefully managed .
He did develop problems with bradycardia which improved with discontinuation of clonidine .
Hospital course was complicated by development of mild pulmonary effusions and shortness of breath , in addition to concomitant increase in creatinine , which was thought to be related to acute renal insufficiency due to IV contrast from the CT scans which he had obtained .
He was cautiously diuresed , and his renal function plateaued and has finally started improving as of today .
He did also have some mild symptoms of gout in his right great toe , and he declined treatment for this condition .
He is being discharged on the above medications , with plans to follow up with Dr. **NAME[TTT] of cardiology as well as with vascular surgery over the next two weeks .
Followup with Dr. **NAME[ZZZ] as scheduled .
