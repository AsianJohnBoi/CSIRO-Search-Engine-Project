VENTILATOR MANAGEMENT NOTE
I am managing this **AGE[in 60s]- year - old female with respiratory and renal insufficiency after a sternectomy for mediastinitis .
On examination , Mr. **NAME[AAA] is awake , alert , and oriented .
Her pigtail catheter in the left pleural space has been discontinued .
Chest x-ray is unchanged .
She still has some bilateral effusions .
Overnight , she has been rested on assist control gas exchanges and reasonable 40% FiO2 and 10 cm water of PEEP .
The current tidal volumes , her peak airway pressures are below 30s .
Plan today is for pressure support trial , which I am going to time after dialysis , which she should receive today .
In terms of her mediastinitis clinic she appears to be improving .
Her white blood cell count remains around 14 to 16,000 .
She is about four weeks through six week course of cefepime and vancomycin .
The last vancomycin trough level was 9 .
I have started her back on some low - dose beta blockade in light of her ischemic heart disease .
