SERVICE :
Cardiology .
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES :
1. Atrial flutter .
2. Status post atrial flutter radiofrequency ablation with upgrade to biventricular implantable cardioverter - defibrillator .
3. Fever and rash .
REASON FOR ADMISSION :
Mr. **NAME[AAA] presented electively on **DATE[Apr 31 2007] , to undergo elective electrophysiology study to delineate his symptoms of palpitations .
Given the patient 's diminished LV function , we also planned at that sitting to upgrade him from a pacemaker to a defibrillator .
LABS AND RADIOGRAPHIC FINDINGS :
On **DATE[May 2 2007] , sodium138 , potassium 3.7 , chloride 104 , CO2 of 24 , BUN 19 , and creatinine 1.3 .
On **DATE[Apr 31 2007] , hemoglobin 16.4 , hematocrit 46.8 , and white count 7.0 .
On **DATE[May 1 2007] , hemoglobin 14.9 , hematocrit 42.9 , and white count 17.1 .
On **DATE[May 2 2007] , hemoglobin 13.6 , hematocrit 37.9 , and white count 12.9 .
Urinalysis on **DATE[May 1 2007] , was negative .
Blood cultures on **DATE[May 1 2007] , showed no growth after 1 day .
Urine culture sent on **DATE[May 1 2007] , shows no growth after 1 day .
On **DATE[Apr 31 2007] , INR 1.0 and PTT 30 .
PA and lateral chest x-ray on **DATE[May 1 2007] , shows 3 leads superimposed upon the right ventricle without evidence of congestive heart failure .
The heart is mildly enlarged .
EKG on **DATE[May 1 2007] , showed sinus rhythm without evidence of atrial or ventricular pacing .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient presented to the short stay unit and then to the electrophysiology study on **DATE[Apr 31 2007] , where he underwent atrial flutter radiofrequency ablation .
The patient was also found to be inducible for monomorphic ventricular tachycardia during that particular procedure and underwent upgrade from a pacemaker to a biventricular defibrillator .
Please see the dictated operative note for details regarding the procedure .
The patient was admitted to a monitored bed overnight .
Through the evening of **DATE[Apr 31 2007] , and into the wee hours of the morning on **DATE[May 1 2007] , the patient ran fevers .
Blood cultures and urine cultures were obtained .
The patient 's white count , the day after the procedure had increased from 7 to 17 , and we opted to keep the patient on IV antibiotics for another day .
Through the day of **DATE[May 1 2007] , the patient remained afebrile ; however , around midnight on **DATE[Apr 2 2007] , again , he was febrile .
His white count , however , on **DATE[May 2 2007] , had come down to 12 .
The patient did develop a rash over his chest , back , and upper arms , the morning of **DATE[May 2 2007] .
Both the patient and the spouse report that the patient experiences rashes like these around once every 6 weeks .
Workup for this rash so far has been inconclusive .
We stopped the patient 's cephalosporin .
We gave the patient 50 mg of IV Benadryl with resolution of his rash .
Regarding the function of the patient 's biventricular defibrillator , we noted , the day after procedure , that there were times when the patient was in the biventricular pacing .
Interrogation , the day after the procedure revealed an LV pacing threshold of 5 V at 0.5 msec and 3 to 3.5 V at 1 msec .
We retested the patient 's pacing threshold in the LV lead twice on **DATE[May 1 2007] , and again got a second pacing threshold measurement of 3 V at 1.0 msec .
We opted to reprogram the outputs on the left ventricular lead to 4 V at 1.0 msec .
Initially , the patient did complain of some diaphragmatic stimulation ; however , this was quite short-lived .
On the morning of discharge , the patient reported no recent ventricular stimulation and hence we kept the patient 's output on LV lead programmed at 4 V at 1 msec .
On the day of discharge , the patient 's lungs are clear .
The left subclavian ICD incision is well approximated , and the Steri-Strips are intact .
There was some mild ecchymoses at the site but no induration and no hematoma formation .
The patient also has ecchymoses at both groins , again , no hematoma formation and he is ambulating without pain and he is able to weightbear .
We are opting to discharge the patient to home today .
He will be seen in followup on **DATE[May 15 2007] , and we have advised the patient to report any new rashes to the office since we will be sending him home on an oral antibiotic .

1. No lifting left arm above shoulder height x 4 weeks .
2. No heavy lifting left arm x 4 weeks .
3. No repetitive movement , left arm x 4 weeks .
4. No driving x 10 days .
5. Diet will be cardiac .
6. Followup .
The patient has a followup appointment to see the University EP Service on **DATE[May 15 2007] .
