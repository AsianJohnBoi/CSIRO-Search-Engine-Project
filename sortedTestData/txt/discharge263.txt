BNP was also slightly elevated .
It was initially thought to be secondary to renal failure ; however , previous echocardiogram which was done on **DATE[Dec 18 2006] , showed estimated ejection fraction of 45% to 50% , basal inferior and posterior akinesis , mild concentric ventricular hypertrophy , mild regurgitation , and mild calcific aortic stenosis .
