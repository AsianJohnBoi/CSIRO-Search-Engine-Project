I continue to see this **AGE[in 60s]- year - old patient status post bilateral lung reduction surgery .
Postop course complicated with respiratory failure , renal failure , anemia .
I examined the patient .
Reviewed the laboratory data , chart data and chest x-ray .
She is hemodynamically stable .
She did have some hemodynamic instability over the course of night , required some Levophed for a short period of time .
Probably related to anemia and drop in her hematocrit .
This morning upon examination she has been off Levophed and continues be off Levophed over the course of day .
Mean arterial blood pressures are running in the mid 70s to 80s millimeters of mercury range .
She has a sinus tachycardia in the 100s .
From a respiratory standpoint she continues to improve .
She had the CPAP weaning trials today and looked fairly good after being on the CPAP for the better part of the day and then switched over to trach mask trials and she clinically looks good at this point in time .
We will rest her tonight and resume on trach mask trials in the morning .
From a hematological standpoint as previously mentioned she was anemic over the course of the night .
Her hematocrit dropped last night to 19.6 .
She had an unit of blood and it was 23.5 and repeat was 20.5 .
At this point there is really no way we can ascertain where she is bleeding from .
There does not appear to be any blood in her GI tract .
She did have a bowel movement which did not look like it was bloody and the lavage in her PEG there was no blood or coffee grounds from this as well .
She had 2 units of packed RBC s .
A repeat hematocrit was 26.7% at this point time and we will follow her hematocrit throughout the course of the night .
Subcutaneous heparin is currently on hold .
From an electrolyte standpoint she is in renal failure .
No evidence of recovery .
Did come off Prisma yesterday and I think at this point in time would hold off , and if she hemodynamically remains stable can try to put her on HD tomorrow .
Otherwise she is on enteral nutritional support which she is tolerating .
From an ID standpoint white count has now normalized at 9.7 .
She is afebrile .
Completed a course of vancomycin for a cellulitic process of the left lower extremity yesterday .
So at this point in time otherwise will continue her current supportive care and management .
Neurologically she remains intact .
CRITICAL CARE TIME :
The critical care time equals 30 minutes .
