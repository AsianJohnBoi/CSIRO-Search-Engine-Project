Please consider my note to be linked to his .
The patient feels well today .
He had no significant fever overnight .
He denies any chills or sweats .
He is eating without any difficulty .
He is having no abdominal pain .
On physical examination , his temperature is 38.4 , blood pressure 126/69 .
Lungs are clear to auscultation and percussion .
Heart , regular rhythm .
Abdomen soft and nontender .
He does have a Foley catheter in place .
I discussed the situation with Dr. **NAME[UUU] who did his cystoscopy and retrograde today , and it appears that the problem is that he has bladder outlet obstruction from prostatic hypertrophy .
There is no evidence of malignancy .
Dr. **NAME[UUU] would like to proceed with a definitive surgical procedure in a few weeks , but would like for his infection to be under better control before proceeding .
The plan at this point is to treat him with antifungal agents for at least 2 more weeks , and to follow with Dr. **NAME[UUU] and myself .
He may be ready for discharge later today .
