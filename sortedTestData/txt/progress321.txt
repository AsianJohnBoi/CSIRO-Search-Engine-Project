EVALUATION DATE :
**DATE[Mar 20 07]
Mrs. **NAME[AAA] is a **AGE[in 60s]- year - old woman status post lung volume reduction surgery .
She continues to require critical care for management of her respiratory failure , adrenal insufficiency , fluid overload , renal failure , malnutrition , and hyperglycemia .
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN :
1. Pulmonary .
Respiratory failure .
Status post lung volume reduction surgery .
I am continuing to manage Mrs. **NAME[AAA] on assist control ventilation rate of 10 , tidal volume 600 , 40% FiO2 , and 7.5 of PEEP .
Chest x-ray shows bilateral effusions .
I will continue to wean her FiO2 and PEEP as tolerated to maintain oxygen saturations at greater than 92% and attempt trach mask trial if possible later today .
2. Cardiovascular .
Extremities are warm and adequately perfused .
She is in a sinus rhythm with mean arterial pressures in the 80s .
She is not requiring inotropic or pressor support at this time .
3. Fluid , electrolytes , and nutrition .
Sodium 131 , potassium 5.0 , and magnesium 2.0 .
I have changed her maintenance IV to D5 normal saline at 75 mL / hour .
4. Infectious disease .
Afebrile this morning with a white count of 8.7 .
She does not appear to be actively infected at this time , and cultures have been negative to date .
5. Renal .
Net positive in overall fluid balance with a declining urinary output .
BUN today is 38 with a creatinine of 2.9 .
Her renal failure appears to be progressing at this time .
I have had a long discussion with both Mrs. **NAME[AAA] and her family in regards to the likely need for dialysis .
I suspect that the etiology of her renal failure is ATN , likely secondary to a hypotensive episode , which I am attributing at this time to adrenal insufficiency .
I think that given Mrs. **NAME[AAA] 's marginal respiratory status , she will be difficult to manage on intermittent hemodialysis , as even modest fluid overload will likely significantly impair her already borderline respiratory status .
Mrs. **NAME[AAA] has been relatively adamant today , in that she does not wish dialysis .
There is no urgent indication for it at this time , and I have asked that her and her family discuss it in depth .
6. Endocrine .
Hyperglycemia .
I will continue sliding scale insulin coverage and NPH insulin to maintain euglycemic control .
I am continuing her baseline dose of prednisone and have supplemented her with hydrocortisone for adrenal insufficiency .
I am continuing Aranesp due to her renal insufficiency and failure .
7. Hematology .
Hemoglobin this morning is 8.6 , likely dilutional with a platelet count of 203 and an INR of 2.4 .
She has been receiving Coumadin due to her lower extremity DVT .
I will discuss the timing of pigtail catheter placement with the Thoracic Service .
8. GI .
Abdomen is soft and benign .
She has been tolerating Replete at 60 mL / hour .
Given her quite marginal renal function , I have switched her to Nepro today and equal caloric rate .
9. Neuro .
Awake , alert , moves all extremities , and does not have a focal neurologic deficit .
10. Prophylaxis .
I will continue Coumadin , Protonix , and head - of - the - bed elevation .
CRITICAL CARE TIME EQUALS 32 MINUTES .
