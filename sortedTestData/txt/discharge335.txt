This was almost all the time stable during the admission .
However , we discontinued Norvasc during this stay .
Her blood pressures were well - controlled on Lisinopril this time .

We actually ordered the patient to get straight cath 4 times a day and we also discontinued her Detrol .
4. Pneumonia :
The patient 's white count started going up during this stay , so we just did a chest x-ray which showed a right lower lobe infiltrate .
So the patient was started here on Zithromax plus ceftriaxone .
5. Urinary tract infection :
The patient 's urine was checked during this stay and urine culture did show that she had a urinary tract infection growing E. coli which was sensitive to almost all antibiotics .
She was started on Cipro for a day and then discontinued after the sensitivities came back as it was sensitive for Zithromax and ceftriaxone as well .

The patient complained of left shoulder pain .
We did a left shoulder x-ray which showed osteopenia of the shoulder and mild narrowing of the AC joint with ( _______________ ) spurring .
