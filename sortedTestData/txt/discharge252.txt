HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient is a **AGE[90+]- year - old male with a past medical history significant for admission to an outside hospital for urinary tract infection treated with unknown IV antibiotics for 3 days .
After discharge , he developed diarrhea 5 days later ; three days after the onset of the diarrhea , the patient presented to the **INSTITUTION Emergency Department with his daughter due to increased confusion , weakness , dehydration , and multiple falls .
The patient was started on Flagyl 500 mg p.o. t.i.d. for presumed C. diff colitis , he had stool cultures and C. diff toxin test which were positive for C. diff toxin .
His stool culture was negative for E. coli 0157:87 , negative for Salmonella , Shigella , and Campylobacter .
He had a urine culture significant for enterococcus which is 10,000 per mL , vancomycin sensitive ; ampicillin , ciprofloxacin , levofloxacin , levofloxacin , nitrofurantoin , and penicillin resistant .
During the course of his stay , the patient experienced mild hyponatremia and hypokalemia .
This resolved with IV fluids and potassium supplementation .
He came in with mild hypomagnesemia also , also corrected with supplementation .
His Liver function panels were notable for low albumin of approximately 2.0 , reference range here is 3.5 to 5.0 .
B12 level was high at 1126 .
He came in with a mildly elevated white blood cell count at 11.8 ; on last check , it was 10.6 which was within normal limits .
Hemoglobin rose from 10.5 to 11.2 at the time of discharge .
He was treated with Coumadin starting at dose of 5 mg nightly and decreased to 2.5 mg for anticoagulation for his chronic atrial fibrillation .
He is to be on the Coumadin as long as he has 24 - hour supervision and is receiving therapy .
Decision on continuation of Coumadin will be made .
We will see how he progresses and recovers .
His PT on **DATE[May 27 2007] , was 16 .
His INR was 1.7 .
He had the following tests done :
RPR which was nonreactive .
He had his TSH checked which was elevated at 5.766 and a free T4 level within normal limits at 1.0 .
He had urinalysis which was trace positive with +1 leukocyte esterase , negative nitrites , 1 to 5 wbc 's and no bacteria seen .
Urine electrolytes were normal .
His urine sodium was less than 20 .
He had the following procedures done :
An acute abdominal series with ( _______________ ) showing no intestinal obstruction .
No air fluid levels or free air .
He has signs of chronic rotator cuff tear of his shoulders .
He also had a head CT without contrast performed secondary to his mental status changes .
This showed no acute intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect .
Fluid levels in the maxillary sinus were consistent with acute sinusitis .
He had an EKG showing atrial fibrillation , the minimal voltage criteria for a left ventricular hypertrophy and ST-T-wave abnormalities ( _______________ ) anterolateral ischemia .
Of note , he had an echocardiogram performed on **DATE[May 22 2007] , which showed preserved left ventricular ejection fraction of 55% to 60% .
Moderately severe tricuspid regurgitation , moderate mitral regurgitation , enlarged atrium .
Aortic valve sclerosis without significant stenosis .
The cardiology consultant felt that as long as the patient was adequately supervised , it would be fine for him to continue his anticoagulation with Coumadin for chronic atrial fibrillation .
His goal INR is 2.0 to 3.0 .
Current INR is 1.7 .
Even off the Coumadin , the patient had a slightly elevated INR , possibly secondary to malnutrition and decreased liver production .
The patient was seen by psychiatry for evaluation of delirium versus dementia .
They felt that most likely his mental status changes were secondary to delirium and his infectious conditions .
At this point , they recommended further followup with regards to dementia , but hesitating to give this diagnosis at this time .
Mental status did improve over the course of this hospitalization , initially oriented to person only .
At the time of discharge , he was oriented to person , month , year , and general time of month like late **DATE[May] , but not to location .
He persisted in having difficulty with his location , although he knew that he was in the **PLACE vicinity .
He is being transferred to skilled nursing facility in a stable condition .
