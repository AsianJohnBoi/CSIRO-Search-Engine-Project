I personally interviewed and examined the patient on **DATE[Nov 23 2007] .
I discussed the case with Dr. **NAME[VVV] .
Please consider my note linked to his note .
The patient is actually doing well at this time , although he is complaining of a variety of issues including some urinary tract bleeding and persistent mild fever .
He denies any chest pain or dyspnea .
He denies abdominal pain , nausea or vomiting , diarrhea or constipation .
On physical examination , his temperature is 99.5 .
His blood pressure is unchanged from previous recordings .
Lungs are clear to auscultation and percussion .
Heart , regular rhythm .
Abdomen soft and nontender .
His memory seemed to be slightly impaired today .
He did not remember some of the conversations that I had with him on **DATE[Nov 22 2007] .
However , he was awake and alert and able to answer questions .
I also talked to the patient 's wife about his clinical situation .
His BUN is 15 , creatinine 1.1 .
His glucose is 109 .
White count this morning was 9200 .
Hemoglobin and hematocrit have remained stable .
He was 9.2 and 26.4 before his procedure , yesterday .
He is 9.4 and 27.3 this morning .
His INR is 2.2 and he is to remain in the therapeutic range .
He does have pink tinge to urine .
IMPRESSION AND PLAN :
This patient is doing well .
I believe his bleeding is minor , relative to his procedure .
The plan is for him to continue with fluconazole for at least 2 weeks .
He will then follow up with Dr. **NAME[UUU] and have another scan done .
Ultimately , he will need to have his prostate removed by Dr. **NAME[TTT] and arrangements are being made for that at this time .
The patient should be able to be discharged to home today with a Foley in place to continue on present therapy with anticoagulation and fluconazole .
He will need to be put on low molecular weight heparin in preparation for his surgical procedure as he does have an artifical valve .
