**INSTITUTION COURSE :
On further evaluation of the repeat MRI scan that Ms. **NAME[AAA] had by myself and Dr. **NAME[ZZZ] , there did appear to be a small punctate region of restricted diffusion in the right occipital lobe that was a subtle change from her previous MRI scan .
However , the patient is not complaining of any visual field defects nor does she have any on objective testing this morning .
This morning , the patient had a brief episode upon awaken of left upper extremity and lower extremity weakness and uncoordination .
This resolved after a few minutes , and the patient was back to her baseline .
The patient is on full maximal medical management for this small thrombus in her proximal MCA .
So , there is no further mechanism for treatment in this setting .
However , the patient is anxious to go to rehab and begin rehab and we concur and feel that the patient is medically clear for discharge .
FOLLOW UP INSTRUCTIONS :
The patient should have an EEG evaluation for possible seizure disorder or seizures in the setting of this stroke at the rehabilitation facility .
Also , the Neurology Service should be consulted for evaluation and interpretation of this EEG .
