I currently continue to see this **AGE[in 50s]- year - old lady , status post bilateral lung reduction surgery , who has had a complicated postop course .
I manage her for respiratory insufficiency , renal failure , volume overload , electrolyte abnormality , and nutritional support , as well as hyperglycemic control .
I examined her , reviewed her laboratory data , chart data , and chest x-ray .
She hemodynamically remains hemodynamically stable , and actually , means are much better than what they were yesterday in the mid 70s in a sinus rhythm .
Clinically , warm and well perfused .
From a respiratory standpoint , she continues to do well off the vent on trach collar , not really tolerating a Passy - Muir valve at this point in time .
From a renal - electrolyte standpoint , she is in renal failure , no evidence of recovery .
Good clearance on CVHDF .
Phosphate was 2.1 , which I did supplement .
I am currently taking off 150 mL an hour .
She is currently almost a liter negative today , with UF of about 1.6 liters .
Otherwise , there is no infectious disease issue .
Her white count is down to 3.4 .
I am unsure what this is secondary to , will watch it .
She continues on prednisone in light that she was adrenal insufficient , and this is for supplement for this issue .
She is on NPH 5 units b.i.d. with adequate hyperglycemic control .
Otherwise , she is on DVT and GI prophylaxis .
She is on enteral feeds which she is tolerating .
Critical care time equals 30 minutes .
