EVALUATION DATE :
**DATE[Oct 07 07]
I personally manage Ms. **NAME[AAA] in the ICU , a **AGE[in 40s]- year - old woman with history of what appears to me to be viral encephalitis and probable viral pneumonitis and delirium with a background of AIDS .
She also has chronic renal failure and is dialysis - dependent .
The patient continues to be quite encephalopathic and delirious .
She is in constant motion and will require some calming agent that does not interfere with her brain dysfunction .
We have selected Seroquel as the least likely to disrupt her already altered brain function and we hope that we can get her under better control in terms of her delirium .
She does not follow commands , she is agitated , she is in constant motion .
She failed a PICC line and will have to go to Interventional Radiology tomorrow for a PICC .
Her chest x-ray looks about the same .
She has patchy infiltrates which to my eye appear to be viral .
Otherwise , her overall condition has changed little .
I think that under the circumstances , because we are unclear of the etiology of this situation , we should be protecting anyone in the room , and we have ordered barriers for her .
Critical care time : 30 minutes .
