EVALUATION DATE :
**DATE[May 31 07]
I personally managed Mr. **NAME[AAA] in the ICU .
A **AGE[in 60s]- year - old man status post stroke , lethargy , somnolence , brain edema , aspiration pneumonitis .
The patient 's overall mental status remains about the same .
He continues to be sleepy and lethargic , but his chest x-ray continues to show bilateral infiltrates .
It is not out of the question that he could be somewhat fluid overloaded as he is quite positive in his intake and output .
He has a large heart and so , therefore , we are diuresing him today to ensure that he is not inadvertently fluid overloaded .
His antibiotics have been changed .
He does not show any evidence of any new significant infection that we can see .
His white count is on a decreasing trend .
His brain failure from edema seems to be resolving slowly as well .
He does respond but he continues to somewhat sleepy .
We have increased his lisinopril .
His blood pressure is somewhat better , well controlled .
He passes air reasonably well on both sides of his chest .
Heart is a regular rhythm .
Abdomen is soft .
He puts out adequate amounts of urine .
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN :
His overall condition continues about the same , except he seems to be a little bit brighter .
We are continuing to follow him expectantly supportively .
Critical Care time 30 minutes .
