HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Ms. **NAME[AAA] is a very pleasant **AGE[in 50s]- year - old who was admitted on **DATE[May 2 2007] .
She was complaining of abdominal pain , nausea , and vomiting .
The patient was admitted and she was given IV hydration .
She had n.p.o.
She was given pain medication , which alleviated her pain .
The patient 's amylase and lipase were initially elevated .
Her lipase was 2779 .

The patient also had , on admission , an elevated creatinine of 4.2 .

The patient was also found to have an initial hemoglobin and hematocrit of 14.7 and 44.6 .

I believe this is her normal hemoglobin and hematocrit with her endstage renal disease .
It did appear that with her iron being 21 and her ferritin 271 , she may need further evaluation .

She had an ultrasound of her abdomen , which shows hypoechoic pancreas unchanged from **DATE[Mar] .
There is no peripancreatic fluid collection .
It is felt that the patient is having a pancreatitis secondary to hypertriglyceridemia .
She will continue on her TriCor and follow up with Dr. **NAME[WWW VVV] .
Of note , the patient states she is somewhat weak .
I had Physical Therapy evaluate her .
They felt that she would benefit from a postacute rehab facility .
The patient refused this .
We will try to get her into home PT .
