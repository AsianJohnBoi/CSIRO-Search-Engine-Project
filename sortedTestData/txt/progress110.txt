The patient was personally seen and examined .
The case was discussed with the house staff , and I agree with the plan as outlined in their note .
Overnight , the patient was transfused 1 unit of blood and with 80 mg of IV Lasix , and she seemed to tolerate it well with no increased shortness of breath .
Last night at approximately 1 a.m. , she was noted to have decreased mental status , and house staff evaluated her and found she had a glucose of 12 .
She was given 2 amps of D-50 and narcan though she is not on any narcotics though , and her glucose slowly improved to 120 with improvement in her mental status .
It is unclear why her glucose came so low .
She was given 4 units of insulin at 9 p.m. for a glucose of 223 .
She has tolerated insulin sliding scale in the past , and she is on no other medications that apparently will cause hypoglycemia .
Currently , the patient says she feels great .
She denies any shortness of breath or chest pain .
She also says her thinking is normal , and she does not feel sweaty in any way .
She is also very appreciative of the bilateral myringotomy tubes that were placed yesterday .
She now can hear much better .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
Vital Signs :
She is afebrile .
Her blood pressure is 105/61 , she is 97% on 3 liters , slightly increased from yesterday .
General :
On exam , the patient looks well and lying down flat in her bed with no acute distress .
HEENT :
On exam , her oropharynx is normal .
Neck :
Her JVP seems to be elevated than yesterday .
Lungs :
She has light crackles at both of her bases today .
Heart :
Regular rate and rhythm .
Abdomen :
Soft .
She has no significant edema .
LABS :
Her lab work was notable for after posttransfusion hemoglobin was 9.6 , after 1 unit __________ 7.8 .
Her BUN was 22 and her creatinine was 1.2 .
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN :
The patient has done overall .
1. GI bleed that prompted her first presentation .
After speaking with the GI fellow and discussions , it appeared that she has continued to have a very low - level bleed from her diverticulosis .
It is felt that at this time that there is no role for further endoscopy to work this up , and she is hemodynamically stable .
We gave her an extra transfusion yesterday to bring up her baseline , and this will just have to be followed up as an outpatient .
She will also follow up with her outpatient gastroenterologist to see if he also wants to intervene though again she is a poor candidate for endoscopy with her other comorbidities .
2. Pulmonary status and her congestive heart failure , likely with the transfusion and IV Lasix she did not go into flash pulmonary edema .
She did just several days ago ; nonetheless , it is apparent that with her elevated JVP , slight hypoxia , and also her crackles on exam , that she can get benefit from some extra IV Lasix .
We gave her 40 mg of that today and then restarted to her baseline regimen .
3. Overnight , hypoglycemia and altered mental status .
It appears this is secondary to hypoglycemia .
Why she went into hypoglycemia is unclear as she ate a good dinner last night and has tolerated small doses of insulin in the past ; nonetheless , since her last hypoglycemia of 12 , she has been followed for 12 hours with good glucoses over 100 .
Clearly , her thinking is back to normal also .
We have discontinued the insulin sliding scale for her .
4. The patient was set to go to back to her nursing home today .
I am comfortable with that as long as her glucoses through the afternoon remain stable and her respiratory status improves after this IV Lasix which I am very confident it will .
She should follow up with both her cardiologist and her gastroenterologist and primary care physician in the next 1 to 2 weeks to follow up on these issues .
