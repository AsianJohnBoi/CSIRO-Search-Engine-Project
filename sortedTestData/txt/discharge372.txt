HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Mrs. **NAME[AAA] is a **AGE[in 70s]- year - old female who was admitted from **INSTITUTION with worsening dyspnea on exertion and shortness of breath .
She was most recently to **INSTITUTION on **DATE[Sep 27] through **DATE[Sep 30 2007] , for lower extremity cellulitis .
She was sent to **INSTITUTION to complete IV antibiotic treatment and to receive physical therapy .
She was treated with IV steroids and antibiotics .
She did have an initial blood culture that showed gram positive cocci .
She was started on vancomycin until final sensitivity showed that this was vancomycin - resistant enterococcus .
Only one bottle of the initial blood cultures was positive for this , thus , the blood culture type remained negative and there is a question of whether this may have been a skin contaminant rather than a true bacteremia .
The patient did have some problems with mental status changes during her hospital stay .
She had them on her last hospital stay and started on Ativan , due to a significant history of alcohol abuse .
She also had problems during her last hospital stay with removing her O2 and having mental status changes when acutely hypoxic .
During this hospital stay , there was some discussion as to whether or not she could return to **INSTITUTION 's **INSTITUTION; the staff there say the patient was refusing to participate in physical therapy .
I discussed this with the patient and her husband today and they both report that because she has not ambulated in two years , she was refusing to walk , but otherwise , participated in therapy .
She currently has a significant right lower extremity flexion contracture that limits her ability to use a wheelchair or transfer and they are hoping she can receive more therapy to relieve this so she can return home to the care of her husband .
At the time of her discharge , she is back to her baseline end stage COPD with no new acute issues identified , other than the question of the VRE , which is felt likely to be a contaminant .
DISCHARGE CONDITION :
Poor and readmission is likely , given the end stage nature of her multiple medical problems .
