Mr. **NAME[AAA] is a **AGE[in 60s]- year - old male with past medical history of hypertension who presented to **INSTITUTION with complaint of transient neurological deficits .
He experienced on one occasion right head weakness and on the other occasion left eye altitudinal visual field defect with dysarthria .
Both episodes lasted several hours and resolved completely .
**STREET-ADDRESS **INSTITUTION , Mr. **NAME[AAA] had an MRI and CT scan done .
The MRI showed scattered foci of restricted diffusion in the left hemisphere .
CTA showed bilateral carotid stenosis and bifurcation and distal left ICA stenosis .
The patient was transferred to **INSTITUTION for further management .
In **INSTITUTION , Mr. **NAME[AAA] underwent angiography that showed
1. Left ICA stenosis at origin .
Recent change to mild left ICA stenosis at origin .
2. Right ICA stenosis ( 60 to 70% ) just above its origin .
3. No intracranial stenosis .
4. Patent posterior circulation .
The patient also underwent transesophageal echocardiography that showed normal left ventricular function and size with ejection fraction of 55 to 60% , no intracardiac shunts , trace mitral regurgitation and trace tricuspid regurgitation , and atherosclerotic disease in aortic arch .
The patient also underwent CT scan of chest , abdomen , and pelvis to rule out malignancy .
This CT scan was preliminarily read by a radiologist as negative for malignancy .
Because the patient presented with 2 different episodes of neurological deficit and these results to foci of restricted diffusion visible on the MRI scan , we decided to start the patient on Aggrenox 1 capsule p.o. b.i.d.
As this patient does not have significant vascular malformations or stenosis and does not have cardiac abnormalities that would predispose him for a stroke did not do any interventions at this time .
The patient 's fasting lipid profile was total cholesterol 250 , LDL 181 , HDL 40 , and triglycerides 182 .
We started the patient on atorvastatin 40 mg p.o. nightly .
We changed the patient 's antihypertensive medication ( nifedipine ) to valsartan 80 mg p.o. q. day .
The patient 's last obtained laboratory values are as follows :
Sodium 142 , potassium 3.8 , BUN 13 , creatinine 1.2 , glucose 79 , and calcium 8.9 .
