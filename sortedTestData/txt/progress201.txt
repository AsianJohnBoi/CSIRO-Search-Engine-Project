I am managing this critically ill , **AGE[in 60s]- year - old female who is status post sternal debridement for sternal wound infection after a CABG , and now postop day one from a pectoralis flap closure .
Hospital course has been complicated by respiratory failure .
I am seeing her for management of these issues .
I have seen and examined the patient , reviewed her laboratory , radiographic , and EMTEK data , and discussed the management with the Critical Care house staff .
Problems and management are as follows :
1. STATUS POST PEC FLAP CLOSURE :
This morning a.m. labs show a hemoglobin and hematocrit of 5 and 17 .
We double checked that and indeed they are true .
She has had about 700 mL out of her four JP s in total of serosanguineous material with some occasional blood and clot .
I have given her packed red blood cells and resuscitated her to a hemoglobin and hematocrit of 10 and 30 , and ordered some q. eight hourly hematocrit checks for the next 24 hours .
She remains on cefepime for her Pseudomonal wound infection .
White blood cell count is down to 24,000 today .
I have changed her vancomycin dosing to q. 24 hours .
2. RESPIRATORY FAILURE :
Chest x-ray shows a slight increase in the bilateral effusions .
This morning I changed her from a pressure support of 20 to a pressure support of 5 , and after a two hour trial she looked like she would be ready to extubate .
Her rapid , shallow breathing index was less than 100 ; however , shortly after extubation she became increasingly tachypneic and I had to reintubate her .
I plan to rest her for a couple of days with most likely outcome being a tracheostomy in the near future for longer term mechanical weaning from mechanical ventilation .
3. ISCHEMIC HEART DISEASE :
She is reasonably well rate controlled now on the current dose of Lopressor , and her heart rate has come down nicely over the course of the day with the blood transfusions .
4. ICU PROPHYLAXIS :
She has stress ulcer and DVT prophylaxis .
I have discontinued her subcutaneous heparin in light of her drifting hematocrit today .
Total critical care time equals 40 minutes excluding procedures .
PROCEDURE NOTE :
INTUBATION .
INDICATIONS :
Respiratory failure .
The patient is sedated with etomidate and relaxed with succinylcholine .
A number three Macintosh blade is used to insert a number seven endotracheal tube through the two vocal cords under direct visualization on the first pass .
I elected to change the number seven tube out to a number eight tube to allow us to suction the patient more adequately and to facilitate weaning in the future .
This was done with a tube changer without difficulty .
We had originally chosen a number seven tube with concerns about possible post extubation stridor , but that turned out to be not a factor .
I was present for and supervised the entire procedure .
