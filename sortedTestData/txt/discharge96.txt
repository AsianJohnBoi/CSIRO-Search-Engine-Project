BRIEF CLINICAL HISTORY :
This is an **AGE[in 80s]- year - old male who initially presented for evaluation at **INSTITUTION where he was complaining of dizziness that had been going on for approximately 1 month .
He is a patient of Dr. **NAME[QQQ PPP] and carries a history of congestive heart failure that has been treated medically , also has had removal of a skin cancer from around the left eye .
His medications included aspirin , nitrates , and diuretics , also included in his list was Vasotec .
At **INSTITUTION , he was found to be in complete heart block with evidence for congestive heart failure and a non - Q - wave myocardial infarction .
He had an emergent dual - chamber permanent pacemaker implanted .
He was treated with diuretics and stabilized with a plan for him to undergo cardiac catheterization .
The patient was brought to **INSTITUTION to undergo that procedure .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
Refer to H and P .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was taken to the cardiac catheterization laboratory by Dr. **NAME[YYY ZZZ] on **DATE[Aug 30 2007] , and the cardiac catheterization findings are as documented .
1. Left main was normal .
2. LAD and his left circumflex had no significant lesions .
3. RCA was large and dominant with a proximal 80% stenosis .
4. LVEF was 55% .
There was evidence for moderate mitral regurgitation .
Intervention included stent dilatation of the RCA that was successful .
Postprocedure , the patient had no complications .
The patient 's platelet count was noted to be 56,000 and his white cell count was elevated to 15,000 .
He was to be seen in consultation by Infectious Disease as well as Hematology specialist , and given the patient 's history of being a chronic smoker and followed in the past by Dr. **NAME[RRR] , pulmonology was also consulted .
The patient was treated by Pulmonology for exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and bronchitis .
Full PFTs were ordered .
MDIs and steroids were managed by Dr. **NAME[RRR] .
Infectious disease specialty attributed the elevated white cell count to be secondary to steroid therapy .
The patient will continue on a tapering dose of prednisone as an outpatient .
His blood sugars were also elevated requiring the addition of Micronase 2.5 mg daily .
Regarding thrombocytopenia , it was considered to be multifactorial .
This included drugs i.e. , aspirin , Plavix , and possibly Vasotec .
Aspirin and Plavix were ultimately permitted to be resumed by Hematology with close followup of platelet count .
Vasotec was discontinued .
A bone marrow biopsy is planned after discharge through hematology service .
The patient remained stable otherwise and was considered to be stable for discharge to home .
His pacer site was clean and dry .
He will follow up as indicated above .
PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA :
Cardiac catheterization and intervention were already mentioned .
Pulmonary function studies , physician interpretation based on the FEV1/FVC , there was a mild obstructive defect .
Lung volumes were within normal limits .
There was a mild decrease in diffusion capacity .
The reduced diffuse capacity suggested anatomic emphysema .
FVC change by 29% .
This is interpreted as a good response to bronchodilator .
His blood pressure was 120/54 , and he was afebrile .
Lungs had few expiratory wheezes .
Further laboratory data and results , please refer to the hospital chart .
