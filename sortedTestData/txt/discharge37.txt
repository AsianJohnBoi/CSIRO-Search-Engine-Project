REASON FOR ADMISSION :
This is an **AGE[in 80s]- year-old female with a past medical history of atrial fibrillation , COPD , and major depressive disorder who was , initially , admitted to **INSTITUTION for depression treatment ; however , she was transferred to **INSTITUTION and then **INSTITUTION to the MICU Service on **DATE[Nov 12 2007] in respiratory distress .
The patient had originally been admitted to **INSTITUTION on **DATE[Oct 20 2007] for worsening confusion without any organic causes , as was described per note .
She was receiving ECT treatment on **DATE[Nov 11 2007] followed by progressive shortness of breath , which caused her to go into respiratory distress and was transferred to the Medical ICU , and upon admission , x-ray showed a right mid-lung pneumonia .
During her hospitalization , the patient also had a cardiac work-up , which was negative for troponins .
EKG showed no acute changes .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was transferred to a Medical floor after a stable condition .
She was , initially , on four-to-five liters of oxygen , which was titrated down , and she was started on Zosyn and vancomycin for hospital-acquired pneumonia and was also on DuoNebs for her COPD .
The patient did well .
Sputum cultures returned from the a tracheal aspiration with abundant epithelial cells and a contamination .
Sputum culture on **DATE[Nov 12 2007] showed moderate white cells , gram-positive cocci in pairs , and a few gram-positive rods .
The cultures did not grow anything , except for rare Streptococcus viridans .
We decided to continue treatment with Zosyn and then discontinued the vancomycin for seven days .
The patient was ready to be discharged back to **INSTITUTION ; however , on the day of **DATE[Nov 18 2007] , she developed respiratory distress due to pulmonary edema .
She was transferred to the MICU and was returned back to the General Medicine Service the next day .
During the MICU stay overnight , the patient was only diuresed with Lasix , but upon return to the General Medicine Service , we continued to diurese her with Lasix .
The patient is now doing well without any complications .
We have decided not to continue with the antibiotics given that the chest x-ray is now clear for any consolidation .
She continues to have pulmonary congestion , which will require some time to clear up .
Otherwise , she will receive DuoNeb treatments for her COPD .
Also , Mucinex will help with clearing up the congestion at 600 mg twice a day .
Cardiovascular .
She is in atrial fibrillation .
We have restarted her Coumadin .
She receives 3 mg of Coumadin on Monday , Tuesday , Wednesday , Thursday , Friday , and Saturday , and 1.5 mg of Coumadin on Sunday .
For rate control , we have added Cardizem CR constant release , which is 120 mg once a day .
She is already on sotalol , which will also benefit with rate control .
