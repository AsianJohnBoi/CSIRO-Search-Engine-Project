I am currently continuing to see this patient , who initially underwent lung reduction surgery for end - stage emphysema .
Her postoperative course complicated with tracheal tear and respiratory failure .
Now , I am managing her as well for respiratory failure , UTI , pneumonia , and renal failure .
I examined her , reviewed her laboratory data , chart data , and chest x-ray .
She hemodynamically has remained hemodynamically stable .
She did tolerate HD yesterday , but was only able to get off 300 mL of fluid .
Otherwise , she remains in sinus rhythm with no other issues .
From a respiratory standpoint , not weaning well , weaned for about an hour or two today on trach mask .
She does have Klebsiella ________ pneumoniae and last night did switch over to Cipro , which I did adjust down to 200 mg of IV q. 12 hours .
She also has Klebsiella in her urine as well as two other gram negatives which are speciated out , probably will not in light that her colony count is only 8,000 .
I think part of what her weaning may also be volume , in fact that we are not able to get volume off on HD as well .
At this point in time , we will rest her this afternoon and we will try another weaning trial .
From a renal electrolyte standpoint , her clearance is better .
Her electrolytes otherwise are within normal limits .
Scheduled for dialysis on Monday .
We will discontinue the tunneled catheter thereafter and discontinue the temperature dialysis catheter on Monday after dialysis , and she is currently scheduled for Tuesday for a tunneled dialysis catheter .
Otherwise , she continues with enteral nutritional support which she has been tolerating .
She is on DVT and GI prophylaxis .
Her hematocrit has remained stable at 28% today , no evidence of bleeding .
We will continue to hold the subcutaneous heparin today as well .
I think it is probably reasonable that she does not bleed the next day or so we will restart it .
Otherwise , she is on GI prophylaxis .
Neurologically , remains intact .
We will otherwise continue her current supportive care management .
CRITICAL CARE TIME = 31 MINUTES .
