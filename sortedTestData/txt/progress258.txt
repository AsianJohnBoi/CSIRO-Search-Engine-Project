The patient is a **AGE[in 20s]- year - old female , status post small bowel transplant and postoperative day number one from exploratory laparotomy for bleeding .
I am currently managing this critically ill patient in the Transplant ICU for respiratory failure .
I have examined Ms. **NAME[AAA] this morning and I have personally reviewed the patient 's medications as well as all of the historical , laboratory , microbiologic and radiologic data pertinent to her care .
All ventilator management has been given under my direction .
The patient has been stable from a hemodynamic and respiratory standpoint overnight and was placed on a spontaneous breathing trial earlier this morning .
RESPIRATORY FAILURE .
The patient 's oxygen saturation is 100% on spontaneous breathing trial with PEEP of 5 , pressure support of 5 and 40% FiO2 .
She achieves tidal volumes of approximately 400 to 500 mL and a vital capacity of almost one liter .
