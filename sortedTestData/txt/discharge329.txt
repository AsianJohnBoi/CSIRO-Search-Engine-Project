The patient is a **AGE[in 40s]- year - old African American moderately obese female who was admitted through the emergency room with a history of one day of abdominal pain , started in the mid abdomen , radiating to the right lower quadrant , some fever and chills .
She tried to have nonsteroidal antiinflammatory which did not give her any relief .

On examination , the patient was with very tender right lower quadrant .
She has guarding and rigidity with positive rebound .
Her white blood cell was quite elevated .
It was 17.1 .
The next day , we examined the patient , and we put differential diagnosis of pelvic inflammatory disease versus acute appendicitis .
Dr. **NAME[SSS] came and see the patient , and he said that his impression is abdomen is relatively soft , some guarding of the right lower quadrant and profound tenderness .
There is no cervical motion tenderness , so it is possible appendicitis , and then the patient was seen by Dr. **NAME[UUU] who decided to go for laparoscopic appendicectomy .
The patient tolerated the operation very well , and on the operative report , he said , possible early appendicitis , laparoscopic appendicectomy by Dr. **NAME[UUU] .
