I personally managed Mr. **NAME[AAA] in the ICU , a **AGE[in 60s]- year - old man status post stroke , lethargy , somnolence , brain edema , recent course of 3% sodium chloride , aspiration pneumonitis , and we strongly suspect continuing aspiration .
His chest x-ray continues to show substantial amounts of secretions and accumulation of infiltrates .
He is on multiple antibiotics .
We are actually standing at the bedside and watching him aspirate .
He continues to have substantial amounts of secretions , and I think that the better part of valor here is to reintubate him and give him tracheostomy for pulmonary toilet .
Discussed this with the neurology attending and with the patient 's family .
The patient is for percutaneous tracheostomy this afternoon .
His laboratory parameters are otherwise unremarkable .
His physical exam is unchanged .
His major difficulty continues to be respiratory .
We will try our best to get this back into some degree of treatment this afternoon .
Critical care time 30 minutes .
