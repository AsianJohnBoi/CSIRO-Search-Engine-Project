Mrs. **NAME[CCC] is a **AGE[in 60s]- year - old woman status post lung volume reduction surgery .
She continues to requires critical care for management of her respiratory failure , renal failure , hyperglycemia , and adrenal insufficiency .
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN :
Pulmonary .
Respiratory failure .
I am currently managing Mrs. **NAME[CCC] status post lung volume reduction surgery on assist control ventilation , rate of 20 , tidal volume 400 , 40% FiO2 and 5 of PEEP .
She was able to only tolerate 30 minutes of trach mask today .
There is occasional wheezing in bilateral lung fields and will drain her right - sided pleural effusion in hopes of improving her pulmonary status and continue duo - nebs for bronchospasm .
Chest x-ray does not show discrete infiltrate .
Her right - sided effusion does appear to have worsened .
Cardiovascular .
Extremities are warm and adequately perfused .
She is in a sinus rhythm with mean pressures in the 80s .
She is not requiring inotropic or pressor support .

Afebrile at 37.3 with a white count of 9.7 .
She does not appear to be actively infected at this time .

Urinary output has been quite marginal between 10 and 25 cc per hour .
Her BUN and creatinine have worsened today at 51 and 3.2 .
I have consulted Nephrology .
She does have considerable anasarca at this time and is markedly volume overload .
I will start a torsemide drip at 10 mg per hour .
Should this fail to improve her fluid balance , it may be necessary to initiate dialysis .
I had a long discussion with Mrs. **NAME[CCC] and her family in regards to the implications of dialysis .
At this time they wish to proceed if necessary .
She does not have absolute indication for dialysis at this moment .

Following the pigtail catheter drainage , I have resumed her heparin drip .
