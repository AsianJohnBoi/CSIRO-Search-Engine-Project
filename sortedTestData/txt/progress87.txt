The patient states that she continues to feel dizzy when she stands up .
She did hit her head she states when she passed out recently at home .
She states that her dizziness did start after that fall .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
On her examination today , she had a few crackles at her right base .
Her heart was regular .
Abdomen was nontender .
Her strength was unchanged .
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN :
1 Temporal arteritis .
She had the temporal artery biopsies come back positive .
We will start her on steroid therapy 30 mg b.i.d.
We are going to discharge her home with close outpatient followup .
She will need to have a close followup to monitor her glucose given high doses of steroid therapy .
She is at approximately 40% risk of having hyperglycemia .
2 Anemia .
Anemia is likely of chronic disease .
She will likely improve .
She will be given iron therapy as well .
3 Vertigo .
We have set up to just be seen at the **INSTITUTION prior to discharge .
I think from our exam she likely has benign positional vertigo may be triggered by her fall .
Her case was discussed in detail with the house staff .
I agree with their note as written .
My note should be considered linked to theirs .
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES :
As above .
