**NAME[YYY M. ZZZ] , M.D.
ADMISSION DATE :
**DATE[Feb 12 2007]
EVALUATION DATE :
**DATE[Mar 13 07]
Date of service is 13 **DATE[Mar 2007] .
I am managing this critically ill **AGE[in 60s]- year - old female with respiratory failure after a mediastinal debridement , hospital course complicated by renal insufficiency and fluid overload .
I am seeing her for management of these issues .
I have seen and examined the patient , reviewed her laboratory studies , radiographic and Emtek data , and discussed the management with the Plastic surgeons .
Problems and management are as follows :
1. Mediastinitis .
White blood cell count remains somewhat elevated at 19,000 , with a low - grade fever .
She is postop day one from evacuation of her hematoma and placement of a left pigtail .
Clinically , the pigtail fluid is not infected and microbiologic results remain negative .
She continues on cefepime , with intermittent dosing of vancomycin for her renal insufficiency .
We continue to look for possible sources of her mediastinal infection , but she seems to be responding to current therapy with debridement and antibiotics .
2. Respiratory failure .
Chest x-ray shows a significant decrease in her bilateral effusions after the drainage yesterday .
On the vent , I have got her on assist control .
Her peak airway pressures and minute ventilation have been adequate .
I have dropped her PEEP from 8 down to 5 today and placed her on a pressure support trial .
She is doing well through most of the afternoon .
I plan to rest her back on assist control this evening .
3. Chronic renal insufficiency .
BUN and creatinine are stable .
She made 2.6 liters of urine on 40 mg of Lasix intravenously every 12 hours .
I have left that dose unchanged .
4. ICU prophylaxis .
I have discontinued her fluconazole for the candiduria , discontinued her IV fluid , added some Pro Source to her tube feedings , and have placed her on an insulin drip for better glycemic control in light of her diabetes and her mediastinitis .
Total critical care time = 40 minutes .
