I am seeing this critically ill man for on - going management of respiratory insufficiency and treatment of his empyema .
I have examined the patient and reviewed the laboratory data and events .
He has a complex history .
He is a **AGE[in 70s]- year - old man with AAA , significant coronary disease , and recent pneumonia with an empyema on the right .
By CT scan , it also looks like he may have a bladder mass .
He is status post drainage of the right chest and does not have full expansion of the lung despite the fact that he has been drained .
These are due to ________ or possibly due to ongoing pneumonia with inability of the lung to fully expand .
The surgical team is going to talk further with the patient about that in regards to possible decortication .
I have reviewed the CT scan , which is striking , in particular , for the amount of coronary disease that he has had .
He has a troponin bump from his drainage procedure , which is a much lower level procedure obviously than the decortication .
He has had a history of cardiac catheterization about 3 or 4 years ago .
He says he was told , reportedly , that he could be stented , but he declined .
At this point , he has declined any coronary evaluation , stenting , or potential CABG if it needed to be done .
I have also discussed with him the possibility of needing repair of that abdominal aneurysm , but he seems pretty comfortable in his declining that also even though he seems to understand the risk of death that might come from a rupture .
At this point , I have discussed with Dr.**NAME[UUU] , the cardiologist .
He feels he has a 20% chance of MI with another procedure .
It is unclear how big that MI would be since his coronaries have not been evaluated , but it is unlikely to pursue cardiac catheterization for prognosis alone .
At this point , continue with drainage , cefepime , vancomycin , and Diflucan given his candida in the bladder .
Renal function is reasonable .
He had some acidosis and shortness of breath yesterday , but he has improved with some resuscitation , and he is down to 6 liters .
Continue supportive care as above .
T = 30 .
