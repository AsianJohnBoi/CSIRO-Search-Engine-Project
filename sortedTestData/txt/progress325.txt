I am seeing this critically patient for continued management of multiple medical problems , including respiratory failure and acute renal failure .
I have seen and examined this patient .
I have reviewed the chest x-ray and laboratory data , and I have discussed the patient 's care with the SICU team and the Thoracic Surgery service .
Mrs. **NAME[AAA] is afebrile this morning .
Blood pressure is running systolic anywhere from the low 100s to mid 100s over 50 to 60 .
She is in about even fluid balance now on a torsemide infusion at 10 mg per hour .
BUN and creatinine are still coming up slowly and are 81 and 4.1 this morning .
She continues to be somewhat volume overloaded ; however , although we are struggling between fluid removal and maintaining her volume status where it is in order to try to facilitate renal recovery .
Her chest x-ray is unchanged .
She is still not tolerating CPAP trials from an oxygenation standpoint , and requires anywhere from 40 to 50% on assist control with 5 of PEEP .
I am continuing the diuretics for now .
She is likely to require dialysis soon .
T = 35 minutes .
