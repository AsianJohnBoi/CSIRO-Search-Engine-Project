**NAME[WWW M XXX]
ADMISSION DATE :
**DATE[Sep 24 2007]
EVALUATION DATE :
**DATE[Sep 29 07]
SUBJECTIVE :
This patient has been transferred out from the Intensive Care Unit to my service .
Her history has been reviewed by me , but essentially , the patient had coronary artery disease with 5 stents placed with thin multiple postoperative complications including a non - Q-wave MI , pancreatitis with a large pseudocyst formation , respiratory failure with trach , C. difficile colitis , 2 thrombosed stents , thrombocytopenia , and thrombosed internal jugular vein .
Currently , she is doing okay .
She has some complaints of lower abdominal pain that she attributes to gas .
She has no complaints of chest pain , shortness of breath , nausea or vomiting .
OBJECTIVE :
Vital signs are currently stable .
Cardiac :
Normal S1 , S2 .
No murmurs , rubs , or gallops are present .
Lungs :
Clear to auscultation bilaterally .
Abdomen :
Soft , but slightly distend with gas .
Normoactive bowel sounds are present .
LABORATORY DATA :
Chem-7 is normal except for a BUN of 22 .
Blood sugars are running basically between 150 and 220 .
Albumin on last check was 2.9 .
Transaminases are normal .
Alkaline phosphatase is up to 417 .
GGTP is 179 ; amylase and lipase are essentially normal .
White count and differential is normal .
H and H is 9.5 and 27.9 .
INR is 1.2 .
C. difficile toxin remains positive .
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN :
1. Cardiac .
The patient has multiple stents now placed with history of acute thrombosis of stents with removal of clot with AngioJet .
For now , I would continue her aspirin and Plavix for stent viability .
I will continue her other current cardiac medications including her metoprolol , Lasix , lisinopril , Pravastatin , and Zetia .
2. GI .
The patient has pancreatitis with a significant pancreatic pseudocyst causing gastric outlet obstruction .
GI Nutrition input is appreciated .
The patient 's J port on her GJ tube has clogged .
We are contacting GI Nutrition for further input and management from that standpoint .
We will again continue with aggressive nutritional supplementation for her , and I would make sure that GI Surgery continues to follow the patient , unlikely that they would perform any intervention for the patient 's pancreatic pseudocyst .
However , I would like them to continue to follow this patient , given her complexity .
Continue to monitor albumin weekly .
In addition , the patient also had additional inspection with EGD when the patient 's GJ tube was being placed that saw clean based ulcers that appeared to have bled recently and therefore we have been holding off on anticoagulation .
GI has actually given us the go ahead on anticoagulation from their standpoint .
We will continue with PPI therapy for now as well .
3. Normocytic anemia , likely due to anemia of chronic disease .
Continue to monitor for now .
4. The patient is status post respiratory failure .
She does have a trach in place .
Continue trach care for now and obtain a Passy-Muir valve for communication purposes .
5. Heme .
The patient has a thrombosed internal jugular vein .
She is already on aspirin and Plavix .
We will start Lovenox on this patient for continued anticoagulation given this thrombosis , and we will watch her very carefully from that standpoint .
6. Infectious Disease .
Continue Flagyl for now for the patient 's active C. difficile colitis , and I would shoot a flat plate of the abdomen since the patient had a rectal tube removed yesterday and is having more gas and bloating today .
