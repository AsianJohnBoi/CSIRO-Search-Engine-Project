**DATE[Mar 01 07]
Mrs. **NAME[AAA] is a **AGE[in 60s]- year - old woman status post lung volume reduction surgery for emphysema .
She continues to require critical care for management of her respiratory insufficiency , malnutrition , tachycardia , hyperglycemia , and fluid overload .
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN :
1. PULMONARY :
Respiratory insufficiency - Mrs. **NAME[AAA] has remained extubated ; however , subjectively she states that her work of breathing has increased and she is more dyspneic today .
She remains on 12 liters / minute flush on BiPAP .
I have tried her on and off BiPAP today with an IPAP of 8 and an EPAP of 5 .
Breath sounds are relatively clear in both lung fields without significant wheeze or rhonchi .
She denies any sputum production but her cough is poor at this time .
At this point , her mental status is acceptable .
She is interactive and does not have clinical signs of significant CO2 retention .
She does , however , remain very marginal in regards to her oxygenation and desaturates with little or minimal effort .
At this point , I would recommend tracheostomy .
She does have a mini trach in place ; however , this is precluding adequate suctioning due to her tracheal tear .
A size 6 tracheostomy tube would facilitate a bronchoscopic toileting and intermittent rests on the vent .
She adamantly states that she does not wish to be reintubated .
We will continue to work with her today as I feel that a tracheostomy would improve her comfort and allow for a rest mode on the ventilator .
She does appear competent in her decision - making today .
We will discuss this further with her family .
I will continue Xopenex for bronchospasm as well as prednisone .
2. CARDIOVASCULAR :
Extremities are warm and adequately perfused .
She remains in a sinus tachycardic rhythm .
I am continuing diltiazem at 5 mg / hour .
Mean arterial pressures are acceptable in the 70s to 80s .
3. GI :
Abdomen is soft and benign .
Given her marginal respiratory status , I would favor postpyloric feeding .
If she undergoes tracheostomy today , I will place a Duo tube .
4. RENAL :
Overall fluid balance is slightly net negative with an acceptable urinary output .
BUN today is 28 with a creatinine of 0.9 .
I intend to gently diurese her with 10 mg of Lasix IV .
5. FLUID , ELECTROLYTES , AND NUTRITION :
Sodium 142 .
Potassium 4.2 .
Magnesium 3.1 .
I have replaced electrolytes per protocol .
6. INFECTIOUS DISEASE :
Afebrile overnight with a white count of 12.6 .
I will complete an eight - day course of Unasyn for Haemophilus parainfluenzae on recent pulmonary culture .
7. HEMATOLOGY :
Hemoglobin this morning is acceptable at 10.9 with a platelet count of 221 .
There is no evidence of active bleeding or clinically significant coagulopathy .
8. PAIN :
I will continue a morphine PCA for pain control .
9. ENDOCRINE :
Hyperglycemia - I will continue sliding scale insulin coverage to maintain euglycemic control .
10. NEUROLOGIC :
Awake and follows commands , moves all extremities , does not appear to have a focal neurologic deficit .
11. PROPHYLAXIS :
I will continue proton pump inhibitor , subcutaneous heparin , and head of the bed elevation .
Critical care time = 32 minutes .
