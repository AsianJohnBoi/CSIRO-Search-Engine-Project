Radiation chemo enteritis .
SECONDARY DIAGNOSES :
1. Rectosigmoid carcinoma .
2. Total abdominal hysterectomy , bilateral salpingo - oophorectomy .
3. Appendectomy .
4. Cholecystectomy .

STUDIES DONE ON THIS ADMISSION :
**DATE[Jul 18 2007] , abdominal series was done showing findings most compatible with ileus .
**DATE[Jul 19 2007] , abdominal CT was done showing dilated loops of small bowel with multiple air fluid levels as well as gas distally in the colon .
Findings most compatible with ileus .
Minimal bibasilar atelectasis , splenic granuloma , status post bowel resection with diffuse infiltrative / inflammatory changes throughout the small bowel and mesentery likely related to a combination of postsurgical changes and radiation change .
In the pelvis there is a distal sigmoid colon mass , probably not significantly changed since **DATE[Apr 2007] .
Subtle nodular thickening just posterior to the anterior abdominal wall and a prior suture line possibly representing granulation tissue , although tumor seeding is possible .
A small amount of pelvic free fluid .
A colon barium enema was done on **DATE[Jul 20 2007] , showing negative evaluation for colonic obstruction , rectal sigmoid mass seen on the CT is not definitively seen on this study .
Abdominal CT was done on **DATE[Jul 23 2007] , with contrast showing partial small - bowel obstruction , enhancement and thickening of the distal small - bowel loops concerning for radiation induced enteritis .
Enhancement and thickening of the region of the rectal anastomosis .
Correlation with a recent colonoscopy is recommended .
A small amount of free fluid within the pelvis with nondrainable fluid collection .
Abdominal series on **DATE[Jul 25 2007] , showed probable small bilateral pleural effusions , gas filled loops of nondistended appearing small and large bowel .
No evidence of obstruction is identified .
No evidence of free intraperitoneal air .
**INSTITUTION ADMISSION :
Mrs. **NAME[AAA] is an **AGE[in 80s]- year - old female with rectosigmoid cancer , currently undergoing chemoradiation , presenting with a one week history of voluminous diarrhea .
The diarrhea was worse on **DATE[Jul 12 2007] , when she had about 10 episodes and has decreased in frequency to only about 2 episodes over the last day or so prior to admission .
The diarrhea is very watery and dark colored .
She has been nauseous on and off with some low grade fevers at her nursing facility in the low 100s .
She also reports some abdominal pain .
No chills , no shortness of breath , no chest pain , no cough .
She had three days of 5FU from **DATE[Jul 8 2007] to **DATE[Jul 10 2007] , and she also had rectosigmoid radiation on each week day since **DATE[Jul 4 2007] , to **DATE[Jul 18 2007] , which is the day of her admission .
She has been living at **INSTITUTION **PLACE since **DATE[May 2007] .
The patient has a history of rectosigmoid cancer diagnosed **DATE[Apr 25 2007] , T3N1M0 .
No surgery has occurred yet .
The medical oncologist , Dr. **NAME[ZZZ] , surgical oncologist , Dr. **NAME[UUU] , radiation oncologist , Dr. **NAME[TTT] .
The patient also has a history of diverticulitis in 1996 where she is status post colonic resection and colostomy reversal in that same year .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
Diarrhea .
Differential for diarrhea was infectious versus chemotherapy radiation induced .
We sent stool studies , Clostridium difficile , fecal leukocytes , O and P , and stool cultures .
We avoided antidiarrheals initially and started IV fluids and Aquaphor for anal discomfort .
All of her infectious workup came back negative and there was concern for a partial small - bowel obstruction based on CT scan and abdominal x-ray .
The patient had continued diarrhea and vomiting during her hospital admission and with surgical oncology 's advice , we placed an NG tube .
The patient felt much better after the NG tube was placed .
She was made n.p.o. and we kept her on D5 saline .
The patient 's abdominal pain , diarrhea , and vomiting all improved once the NG tube was placed .
She had the NG tube placed for about 3 days and when it was removed , her abdominal pain , diarrhea , and vomiting were still improved .
We started her on clear liquids .
She tolerated that well .
We advanced her as tolerated .
She is taking good p.o.
We stopped her IV fluids .
She is doing much better .
During her time of having the NG tube , she did not receive any nutrition for approximately a week , so she was started on TPN for three days and that was stopped when she was taking adequate p.o.
She will be sent back to **INSTITUTION with the notion that this diarrhea and abdominal complaints were caused by her chemoradiation enteritis .
She will see Dr. **NAME[TTT] , her radiation oncologist , this week , and see Dr. **NAME[ZZZ] next week for reassessment of plan for her treatment .
Abdominal pain .
The patient had significant abdominal pain with rebound tenderness on admission .
Surgical oncology saw the patient as well .
She did not have an acute abdomen .
We believe that this was caused due to either a partial small - bowel obstruction or chemoradiation enteritis .
We also consulted GI , Dr. **NAME[SSS] , in this case as well .
Barium enema was done on **DATE[Jul 20 2007] , to rule out colonic obstruction which was negative for obstruction .
The patient 's abdominal pain persisted and was concurrent with her nausea and diarrhea during her hospital admission .
Once the NG tube was placed , her abdominal pain improved greatly when she received some bowel rest , when she was n.p.o. and had the NG tube in .
The abdominal pain subsided almost completely after the NG tube was placed and thereon after .
Cardiovascular .
The patient came in on Lasix and Lipitor .
We held her Lasix and continued the Lipitor .
Endocrine .
The patient came in on Synthroid , iron , and folate which were continued during hospital admission .
She received prophylaxis with SCD s and Protonix .
The patient seemed very anxious on admission when she received Risperdal initially , and then she was started on Klonopin p.r.n.
PT / OT have been working with her during this hospital admission , and will continue to work with her at **INSTITUTION .

1. Mylanta 30 mL p.o. q. 4 hours p.r.n. dyspepsia .
