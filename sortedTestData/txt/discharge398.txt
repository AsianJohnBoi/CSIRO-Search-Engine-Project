Procedures
1. LHC ( **DATE[Oct 2 07] )
1. The LMCA has no significant disease .
2. The LAD is occluded in the mid segment beyond D1 .
Weak L --&gt ; L and R --&gt; L collaterals are present to the distal vessel .
3. The LCX has luminal irregularity .
4. The dominant RCA has a proximal 60% stenosis .
5. LVEDP 30 mmHg .
Ventriculogram deferred .
6. PCI of LAD accomplished by placing a 3.5/23 mm cypher stent in the mid segment .
Some plaque / thrombus shifted into large D2 , so kissing balloon used to simultaneously inflate both the LAD and diagonal branch .
Mild ( 10% ) residual stenosis noted in LAD with TIMI 2 flow .
Poor myocardial blush present in distal LAD territory .
2. TTE ( **DATE[Oct 3 07] )
Diastolic Diameter :
4.3 cm ( 3.5-5.5 cm )
Aortic Root :
3.0 cm ( 2.0-3.7 cm )
Systolic Diameter :
3.0 cm ( 2.5-4.0 cm )
Left Atrium :
4.1 cm ( 1.9-3.8 cm )
Septal Thickness :
1.7 cm ( 0.7-1.2 cm )
Post. Wall Thickness :
1.7 cm ( 0.7-1.1 cm )
TWO DIMENSIONAL ECHOCARDIOLOGY :
Left ventricular size is normal .
Left ventricular wall thickness is increased , consistent with severe left ventricular hypertrophy .
Segmental left ventricular function is abnormal .
The entire anterior wall , entire anterior septum and entire apex are severely hypokinetic .
The remaining segments are normal .
Overall left ventricular function is mild to moderately decreased , with an estimated ejection fraction of 35-40 % .
Right ventricular size is normal .
Right ventricular wall thickness is normal .
Right ventricular function is normal .
Left atrial size is mildly enlarged .
Right atrial size is normal .
The pulmonary artery size is normal .
The aortic root size is normal .
The aortic valve is normal .
The mitral valve is normal .
There is mitral annular calcification .
The tricuspid valve is normal .
The pulmonic valve is normal .
No pericardial effusion is seen .
SPECTRAL DOPPLER :
There is mild aortic regurgitation .
There is trace tricuspid regurgitation .
The peak tricuspid regurgitant velocity is 3.1 m / sec .
With an assumed right atrial pressure of 10 mmHg , the estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is 48 mmHg .
COLOR FLOW DOPPLER :
There is mild aortic regurgitation .
There is trace tricuspid regurgitation .
FINAL IMPRESSIONS :
01) Nondilated left ventricle with severely hypokinetic entire anterior wall , entire anterior septum and entire apex and mild to moderately decreased systolic function .
02) Mild aortic regurgitation .
03) Mitral annular calcification .
04) Mild left atrial enlargement .
05) Mild pulmonary hypertension .
Hospital Course
Mr. **NAME[CCC] is a **AGE[in 70s] yo CM with PMHx as detailed above who presented with c/o crushing , substernal chest pain , **DATE[Jul 11] in severity that radiated down both arms ; the patient took two sublingual nitroglycerins without relief .
The chest pain was associated with nausea ; there was no associated shortness of breath , lightheadedness , sweating or emesis .
The pt reported intermittent chest heaviness / tightness for several weeks prior to admission .
At that time , the pt saw his doctor who ordered an adenosine NST ( done in **DATE[Sep 07] ); per a prior note , the test revealed anteroseptal ischemia with an EF of 44% .
The patient was going to have a LHC done in near future .
Upon presentation at our facility , an EKG was found to demonstrate ST elevations in V2 and V3 as well as reciprocal inferior changes .
The patient was started on a heparin drip and he was given ASA 81 mg x 4 , 6 mg IV morphine and nitropaste and he was chest - pain free .
The patient was taken to the cath lab where he was found to have an occlusion in the mid LAD s/p cypher stent to this segment .
The remainder of the patient 's hospitalization is summarized below .
1. CAD s/p anterior STEMI .
LHC done **DATE[Oct 2 07] with cypher stent to mid LAD .
Post - cath , the patient was treated with Reapro x 12 hrs post - cath , heparinization , plavix , a statin and beta - blockade .
Serial troponins were followed until they trended down ; troponins peaked at 79.4 .
The patient was entrolled in a study using the nitric oxide protocol post - cath as well .
2. LV dysfunction .
TTE done **DATE[Oct 3 07] revealed severe hypokinesis of entire anterior wall and anterior septum with an LVEF of 35-40% .
Given the severe anterior HK , the pt was transitioned from heparin to coumadin .
The pt will need repeat TTE in near future to reassess LV function at which point the need for continued anticoagulation can be determined .
In addition , the patient was discharged on an ACEI and beta - blocker .
3. Hypertension .
The patient 's blood pressure was controlled with quinapril , metoprolol and hydrochlorothiazide .
He was discharged on metoprolol and the combo agent accuretic .
4. Type 2 diabetes .
The pt was diagnosed with diabetes two weeks prior to admission .
The patient was continued on his outpatient regimen of glipizide 10m g po bid .
Discharge Medications
1. Coumadin 5 mg po Qhs x 2 days , then as per anticoagulation clinic .
2. Metoprolol 125 mg po bid .
3. ASA 81 mg po daily .
4. Plavix 75 mg po daily x 1 yr .
5. Accuretic 10/12 5 mg po daily .
6. Glipizide 10 mg po daily .
7. Simvastatin 40 mg po Qhs .
8. Paroxetine 20 mg po daily .
Instructions
1. Diet : cardiac .
2. Activity : as per cardiac rehab evaluation and recommendations .
3. Follow - up with Dr. **NAME[VVV] ( cardiology ); pt to schedule appointment .
