EVALUATION DATE :
**DATE[May 04 07]
I personally interviewed and examined the patient .
The care plan was discussed with the resident team .
Please consider this note linked to the resident note .
The patient has had an uneventful night .
She is feeling relatively well this morning .
Her affect is brighter , and she states she would be agreeable to having the Foley catheter discontinued and using a bedside commode .
The Foley catheter was placed initially to better evaluate her volume status , but ultimately because of discomfort with urination , it was kept in place because of her vaginal wounds .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
She is afebrile .
Blood pressure is 140/69 , heart rate 98 , and temperature is 37.2 .
General :
She has a brighter affect , smiles today for the first time that I have seen .
Her lungs are clear to auscultation .
Heart sounds regular rate and rhythm .
Skin is unchanged .
Labs are detailed in the resident note and are reviewed by me in their entirety and are notable for her being guaiac - positive with a white count that is up to 13.6 today from 8.4 yesterday with 79% neutrophils .
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN :
1. ID .
Wound culture has not yet been reported .
She was placed on Augmentin 250 t.i.d. on the third .
Her white count is slightly elevated ; today , she remains afebrile .
I will continue to monitor .
Clinically , she is much improved .
2. Hypertension .
This does appear to be persisting .
It could be secondary to her steroids however .
We will not treat at this point .
3. Lupus .
On Plaquenil .
Following CBC and steroids .
4. GU .
Discontinue Foley , get bedside commode .
5. Disposition .
Yet to hear if the patient is walking , and we need to assess this to better judge what would be the best discharge plan for her .
