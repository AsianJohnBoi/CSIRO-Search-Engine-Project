I personally provided critical care services for this patient as the resource intensivist at the request of the patient 's primary team .
The patient complains of sudden - onset chest pain times ten minute duration which was only partially relieved by sublingual nitroglycerin and oxygen .
He has been in the hospital for two days - being treated for a bleeding duodenal ulcer , though he has not thrown up or passed blood today .
His hemoglobin this morning was 8 and he has previously received 3 units of packed red cells to bring it to this point .
Upon initial evaluation , he was awake , alert , in no apparent distress and had just received a second nitroglycerin which had reduced , but not completely eliminated the pain .
His systolic blood pressure was 110 with a heart rate of 60 to 70 ( he is on atenolol ) .
He was breathing comfortably and chest pain was not duplicated with palpation of the chest or stomach .
EKG revealed PVC 's but no acute ST segment changes .
I asked the Chest Pain Service to see him who recommended transfer to the Pavilion for further monitoring and treatment .
This will include transfusion of 2 - units of packed red blood cells , oxygen , IV nitroglycerin , serial cardiac enzymes and EKG 's , as well as cardiac monitoring .
Should the patient rule in for a MI , or demonstrate significant EKG changes , we will need to consider taking him to the Catheterization Laboratory - though we will need to carefully balance the risks of further GI hemorrhage .
I spent 30 minutes of critical care time on this patient .
