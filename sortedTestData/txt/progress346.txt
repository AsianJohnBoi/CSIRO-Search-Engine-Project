I am continuing to follow this patient who is status post double - lung reduction surgery .
Postoperative course has been complicated .
I am currently managing her for the following Critical Care issues :
Respiratory failure , renal failure , volume overload , nutritional support .
I examined her , reviewed her laboratory data , chart data and chest x-ray .
Hemodynamically , she has remained hemodynamically stable .
She came off Levophed late last night and has been off Levophed with means now running somewhere in the mid 60s to mid 80 mmHg range .
She remains clinically warm and well - perfused and remains in sinus a rhythm .
She continues on prednisone 10 mg for adrenal insufficiency .
From a respiratory standpoint , she has improved .
She actually came of the vent this morning and went on trach mask this morning .
Will let her go as long as she tolerates and will rest her tonight .
From a renal electrolytes standpoint , she is in renal failure .
There is no evidence of recovery at this point in time .
She is on CV HDF removing 50 an hour which I did increase to 100 an hour , and she if tolerates this in six hours , we will go up to 150 an hour .
From a GI , nutrition standpoint , the patient 's abdominal pain is much improved .
The abdomen is soft , though slightly distended and tender yesterday .
CT scan pretty much was only remarkable to show some chronic cholelithiasis , but nothing new .
She probably has some chronic gallbladder disease with still some sludge .
She is due to get an abdominal ultrasound today which I will restart her enteral feeds and discontinue her IV fluids .
Otherwise , from an ID standpoint , her white count is now normalized .
She has remained afebrile .
Her cultures are negative to date .
Will continue antibiotics until cultures are final .
If nothing grows , we will discontinue her antibiotics .
Otherwise , at this point in time , her hematocrit is down from an hematologic standpoint at 23 .
One ________ did close down , ___________ it may be secondary to this .
There does not appear to be any active signs of bleeding .
Therefore , I will continue the subq heparin for DVT prophylaxis and she is also on GI prophylaxis .
Otherwise , we will continue her on current supportive care management .
CRITICAL CARE TIME = 31 MINUTES .
