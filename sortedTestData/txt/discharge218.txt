REASON FOR ADMISSION :
Mr. **NAME[AAA] is a **AGE[in 60s]- year - old male who is status post a double lung transplant in **DATE[Jan 2007] who had a relatively uncomplicated perioperative course ; however , he was doing progressively worse at home and was admitted in **DATE[Apr 2007] with fever and increasing oxygen requirements .
During the course of his workup , he was found to have diffuse pulmonary infiltrates , which were biopsied .
This was inconclusive as the results showed he had diffuse alveolar hemorrhage and sclerotic changes .
He was treated for potential infection initially , although his cultures were negative .
His Prograf levels were low and he was treated with steroids .
However , two days prior to his death , he was found to have progressive pancytopenia and hypotension .
In addition , bloody tracheal secretions and a GI bleed were noted .
Hematology and GI consultations were obtained and it was felt he had thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and he underwent plasmapheresis and escalation of his steroid treatment .
However , he progressively got worse , requiring maximal vasopressor support over the past 24 hours .
An ongoing discussion with this wife was held regarding the evolving futility of his aggressive care .
She agreed to no chest compressions or defibrillation in the event of arrhythmia , but wanted to press on with aggressive medical care .
In the afternoon of his death , four out of four bottles of blood cultures returned with gram-negative rods and he was started on ciprofloxacin .
However , his blood pressure became increasing difficult to support and his blood glucose was 18 with potassium in the 7 range .
He went into asystolic arrest , which transiently responded to insulin , calcium , and bicarbonate .
Eventually , he went into a systolic arrest and was unrecoverable .
No heart sounds were auscultated .
His pupils were fixed and dilated .
No breath sounds when the ventilator was turned off were heard .
Time of death :
4:50 p.m.
