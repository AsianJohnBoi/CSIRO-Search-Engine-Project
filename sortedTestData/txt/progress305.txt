I am seeing this critically - ill woman this morning for respiratory failure , mechanical ventilatory support and worsening subcutaneous emphysema in the setting of her bronchial tear as well as bilateral small pneumothoraces .
From a respiratory standpoint , the radiograph did not look really significantly worse .
She has small bilateral air spaces .
Her left tube was already on suction .
I put her right tubes on suction too , but I do not expect a huge difference since I suspect that she may be leaking air into her subcutaneous space , mostly perhaps through her bronchial tear .
I spoke with Dr. **NAME[ZZZ] at the bedside and our goal is going to be to try to get her extubated today .
If she has even a fair weaning trial , we have elected to do so .
Her respiratory status is marginal , but currently acceptable with CO2 running about 61 to 64 .
O2 saturations are reasonable on 50% FiO2 and she feels acceptable .
She still has reasonable work of breathing , but her underlying lung disease is pretty severe .
She has a heart rate of about 120 at this point .
Will continue to follow her closely and may need BiPAP to try to keep her from getting reintubated .
Hemodynamics are reasonable .
I have her on an insulin infusion , propofol is off , on empiric Unasyn .
She has some H. influenzae in her sputum .
I would continue that at this point .
Continue her theophylline and prednisone .
She has been on some additional hydrocortisone .
Continue supportive care for this critically - ill woman .
