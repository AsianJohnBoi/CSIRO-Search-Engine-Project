I am managing this critically ill **AGE[in 60s]- year - old female who is status post sternal debridement for mediastinitis , status post CABG surgery .
Her hospital course has been complicated by respiratory failure , acute renal failure , and fluid overload .
I have seen and examined the patient and reviewed her laboratory , radiographic , and EMTEK data , and discussed the management with the plastic surgeons .
Problems and management are as follows :
1. Acute renal failure .
The rise in the BUN and creatinine have plateaued and the peak BUN and creatinine were 97 and 3.5 , and today 's BUN is 64 and creatinine is down to 2.8 .
Her potassium is 3.5 .
The potassium level did respond to Kayexalate .
We started the patient also on intermittent dialysis through a dialysis catheter .
The patient is tolerating the dialysis well .
2. Respiratory failure .
The chest x-ray shows the pigtail is in good position .
There still seems to be a small left - sided effusion and a subsegment of atelectasis .
On the ventilator , I am trying to switch the patient to pressure support ventilation on a pressure support setting of 8 and PEEP of 8 , and will try to wean down those settings .
The patient has previously failed tracheal mask trials , but we will try in the afternoon another trach mask trial again .
3. Mediastinitis .
The patient is on a six - week course of cefepime .
The white blood cell count is recently down to 8.5 today , and her fever / temperature also came down for a Temperature max of 36.5 .
