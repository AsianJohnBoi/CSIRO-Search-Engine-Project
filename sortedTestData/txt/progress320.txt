I am seeing this critically ill woman for management of respiratory failure , mechanical ventilatory support , volume overload , renal failure , nutritional support .
I have examined the patient , reviewed the laboratory data , chest x-ray film , and events of the evening .
I have discussed the case with the surgical team at the bedside .
She was placed back on full mechanical support over the weekend for CO2 retention .
She was on full mechanical support last night .
I began her on trach mask .
She lasted about an hour and a half this morning .
She has been rested subsequently on full support , breathing 20 on top of 20 , 40% FIO2 .
She has got significant volume overload .
She is positive about eight liters over the past four days .
Despite that , her renal function is worse with a creatinine up to 2.4 .
I have asked to send off fractional excretion of sodium on her today as well as urine for eosinophils .
The source is not clear .
She had been on vancomycin .
She might have an interstitial nephritis due to that and she may have been a little dry but at this point , her volume status is more than acceptable .
Her blood pressure is also reasonable with mean of 82 and I do not think there is any ongoing issue causing prerenal oliguria .
Her Accu-Cheks are 230 .
Would increase her sliding scale .
She is on hydrocortisone which we have continued for stress doses in the setting of her severe underlying lung disease .
I have spoken with the thoracic team .
They are going to place a feeding tube and start some enteral nutritional support .
We can cut back her IV fluid at that point .
No evidence of infection currently .
Continue supportive care as above .
