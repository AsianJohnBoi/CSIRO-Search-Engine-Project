ASSESSMENT AND PLAN :
1. Fever .
He is currently on Zosyn and vancomycin on **DATE[Jun 2 2007] .
He is being followed by the ID Service .
We had a long discussion with them .
There is no clear origin of his fevers at this point .
It could be secondary to his underlying disease although this is a diagnosis of exclusion .
At this point , we will redo some blood cultures from both his PICC line and from his blood today .
If his cultures are negative , we can assume that it is a possibility that his underlying disease is causing his fevers .
His regular Infectious Disease physician , Dr. **NAME[TTT SSS] who will be coming back in town tomorrow and will likely discuss his case with her .
2. GI .
He has had persistent gas - like abdominal pain .
We will have the GI Service see him as well as the GI Surgery Service who felt that a colonoscopy might be warranted to make sure that he did not have any evidence of disease in his colon .
Therefore , he was prepped last night with GoLYTELY and had a colonoscopy which is as noted above .
Given the fact that he has mildly improving symptoms , plan will be to continue with his current medicines and diet , we will hold off on giving him steroids for now .
3. DVT , left upper extremity .
He is currently on Coumadin and his INR is 1.5 .
I will give him 3 mg of Coumadin tonight and continue with his heparin drip .
4. Acute renal failure .
His INR was 1.6 today , which has been stable for the last few days .
The Renal Service has been following , and they feel that it could be likely secondary to the high - dose spectrum he was getting .
This has been discontinued , and we will continue to follow .
