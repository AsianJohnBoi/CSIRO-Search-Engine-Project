This is a patient of Dr. **NAME[YYY ZZZ] .
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES :
1. Cadaveric renal transplant in **DATE[Mar 2006] for congenital renal dysplasia .
2. Chronic rejection on rapamycin .
3. Iron - deficiency anemia .
4. Rapamycin pneumonitis .
CONSULTS :
1. Renal Medicine .
2. Pulmonary Medicine .
3. Transplant Infectious Disease .
PROCEDURES :
1. Chest x-ray on **DATE[Mar 19 2007] showing patchy airspace disease on the right side greater than the left suggesting pneumonia with underlying volume overload and cardiomegaly .
2. CT scan of the chest on **DATE[Mar 19 2007] showing diffuse interstitial disease with small areas of consolidated airspace disease likely due to atypical pneumonia with pulmonary edema or medication side effects was likely .
Also , an abdominal CT scan was secondary hyperparathyroidism and hypoattenuating lesions in the liver some of which was due to focal fat , as well as possible gallstones or gallbladder sludge .
3. Blood cultures x 2 and urine culture on **DATE[Mar 20 2007] which found no growth at 2 days at the time of discharge .
4. Urinary Legionella antigen which was negative .
5. Repeat chest x-ray on **DATE[Mar 22 2007] showed little interval change from the previous one on **DATE[Mar 19 2007] .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a **AGE[in 30s]- year - old female with past medical history significant for congenital renal dysplasia status post cadaveric renal transplant in **DATE[Mar 2006] .
She has a history of at least 2 documented episodes of chronic rejection in **DATE[May 2006] and **DATE[Jul 2006] for which she was initially placed on CellCept and then changed to Rapamune when she had an uncontrollable diarrhea on the CellCept .
She also had IV Solu-Medrol at the time of her rejections .
She presented to the Emergency Department with symptoms of cough and hemoptysis for the past month .
She states the symptoms __________ was before Christmas of the past year .
She felt congestion of her chest as well as cough .
She had clear expectoration but recently this had specks of blood .
She denied any fevers or night sweats .
Her nephrologist from home had told her that she would probably need intravenous iron therapy and thought that her shortness of breath might be due to anemia .
She had a chest x-ray done on an outpatient basis which showed a lesion suspicious for tuberculosis and hence was referred to **INSTITUTION for further workup and management .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
1. Cadaveric renal transplant in **DATE[Mar 2006] as above .
2. Chronic rejection x 2 .
3. Left arm AV fistula .
4. Iron - deficiency anemia .
5. Hypercholesterolemia .
6. Migraine .
MEDICATIONS :
At home include :
1. Bactrim .
2. Aspirin .
3. Lasix .
4. Toprol XL .
5. Tacrolimus .
6. Rapamycin .
7. Sodium bicarbonate .
8. Magnesium gluconate .
9. Oral contraceptive pill .
10. Depakote .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
The patient was afebrile with stable vital signs .
Her blood pressure was slightly elevated at 162/100 .
She was saturating 98% on room air .
Her physical exam was positive for pallor on eye exam .
Her chest exam showed clear breath sounds over the right , middle , and lower lobes .
Her belly was soft and nontender and her lower extremity were without edema .
At this time , it was felt she should be admitted to 12-North for respiratory isolation , oxygen as needed , and antibiotic management .
She was started on cefepime and Zithromax for community - acquired pneumonia and a CT scan of the chest was obtained .
The results are as noted above .
Pulmonary Medicine was consulted to see her and recommended that she undergo diuresis .
They felt that the most likely cause is an atypical microorganism and thought that the cefepime was not necessary and that the Zithromax should be sufficient to control her pneumonia .
Additionally , she had rapamycin level drawn that was 21 which is above the upper limit of normal and her rapamycin was withheld , given the thought that this might be rapamycin pneumonitis .
She was given a couple of doses of IV Lasix and diuresed briskly in response to this .
B-type natriuretic peptide on the time of admission was 1571 further supporting that she may have been somewhat volume overloaded .
The Pulmonary consult team did consider that she should undergo transthoracic echocardiogram ; however , this can be scheduled on an outpatient basis .
They did feel that TB was an unlikely cause of her atypical pneumonia and did take her off the isolation precautions .
She never was able to bring up a sputum sample that was sufficient for culture during her hospital stay .
They thought another potential likely cause would be CMV and the PCR for this was negative however .
They also recommended to check Legionella urine antigen and that was also negative .
Their final recommendation was that she undergo a CT scan of the chest repeated when she was at her driveway .
They did not feel that she had any immediate indication for bronchoscopy or bronchial alveolar lavage at the time of her admission .
Renal Medicine was also consulted to see her for her chronic kidney disease as well as her iron - deficiency anemia .
An iron level was sent which came back at 27 with a lower limit of normal at 65 .
She had a ferritin level which was 110 , which was within normal limits .
They did say that she would require intravenous iron replacement and that this could be done on an outpatient basis so as not to hold up her discharge .
They also recommended a PTH level , which turned about to be about 689 .
By hospital day #3 , she was feeling quite a bit better .
Her cough was improving and she had no further dyspnea .
At this time , I felt she was stable for discharge to her home .
At the time of discharge , she was awake and alert .
Her heart was regular and her lungs were clear .
Her abdomen was soft , nontender , and nondistended .
Her previous incisions were all well healed .
Her legs were without edema and her neurologic exam was without deficit .
