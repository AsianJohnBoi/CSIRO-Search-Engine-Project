CHIEF COMPLAINT :
CHEST DISCOMFORT AND HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Mrs. **NAME[BBB AAA] is a **AGE[in 70s]- year - old woman with a past medical history significant for end - stage renal disease on hemodialysis Monday / Wednesday / Friday , hypertension , CHF , pulmonary edema , diabetes mellitus , among other diagnoses , who presented herself to **INSTITUTION for follow up with the Vascular Surgery for a recent AV fistula placed on **DATE[Feb 28 2007].
Reportedly , she began to complain of shortness of breath and chest discomfort and she was told to present herself to the **INSTITUTION ER .
At the ER , she was found to have a systolic blood pressure of over 200 and this precipitated her admission to **INSTITUTION Hospital .
Mainly , she was admitted for a rule - out MI and control of her high blood pressure .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Hypertension , CHF , pulmonary edema , hemodialysis Monday / Wednesday / Friday , anemia , diabetes mellitus , neuropathy , retinopathy , CVA with resulting left hemiparesis , dysarthria , anxiety .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
As stated above , the patient was admitted to the hospital mainly for a rule - out MI and hypertensive crisis .
Immediately , we did begin to titrate her medications to assist her pressure in coming down .
She did require p.r.n. hydralazine at times , as her pressure was elevated .
We did increase her lisinopril to 40 mg p.o. each day from 10 mg p.o. each day , which was her outpatient dosage .
We also did consult Renal Service to continue her hemodialysis while in-house , which likely was helping to contribute to her hypertension .
Upon admission , she did have a chest x-ray on **DATE[Mar 25 2007] , which showed mild cardiomegaly with cephalization of the pulmonary vasculature , mild airspace opacity , compatible with mild edema .
After titrating her blood pressure medications and starting dialysis here in the hospital , a repeat chest x-ray on **DATE[Mar 27 2007] , did show no evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease and no evidence of pulmonary edema .
Also , BMP done on admission was 1730 , BMP done 2 days later was 668 , indicating better control after fluid removal from hemodialysis .
Overall , the patient 's blood pressures over the next few days did start to come down .
On the day of discharge , her blood pressures are running between 130 and 160 , which for the patient is much improved .
She did have troponins negative x 3 and she did have EKG s which did not show any EKG changes .
It is felt that her chest discomfort is likely due to the pulmonary edema seen on chest x-ray as well as her hypertension .
Both of these are well-controlled .
At this time , the patient is stable and will be ready to be discharged today .
Her Ranexa will be restarted as an outpatient and she will be discharged on lisinopril 40 mg p.o. each day instead of her 10 mg that she was on previously .
At this time , she is felt have reached maximum hospital benefit and is ready to be discharged back to her home .
