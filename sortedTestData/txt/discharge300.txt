TRANSFER DIAGNOSIS ( ES ) :
RIGHT INTERNAL CAPSULE ISCHEMIC STROKE .
ALLERGIES :
IODINE WITH REACTION OF SKIN BREAKDOWN .
SECONDARY DIAGNOSIS ( ES ):
HYPERTENSION .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a **AGE[in 70s]- year - old woman with a history of untreated hypertension .
She has good neurologic function at baseline and works at a daycare and taking care of her husband .
She was at work this morning , and about 1:30 p.m. she developed left - sided weakness .
She denies any visual changes or speech difficulty .
She recalls that she could not feel where her left arm was and that there may be some sensory loss .
By the time she arrived at **INSTITUTION at approximately 2 p.m. she was almost back to baseline .
She had mild left leg weakness .
At **INSTITUTION , she underwent a CT of the head which was normal .
However , after the CT scan , she had recurrence of left hemiparesis and it has been fluctuating since then .
The patient reported that she had four worsenings so far and reported having been good for the past hour or more ; yet she has had some left - sided weakness that is mild .
Currently , she denies any numbness , visual changes , or speech difficulties .
For further review of systems and physical examination , please see initial H&amp ; P .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
During the patient 's hospital stay , she had several laboratory studies drawn .
Of note , she had a fasting lipid profile which showed triglycerides of 90 , cholesterol of 264 , LDL of 192 , HDL of 58 , VLDL of 14 .
She also had a hemoglobin A1C of 5.8 .
The patient was subsequently eventually placed on heparin and Coumadin therapy , and her current INR is 1.1 .
DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES :
The patient had a CT of the head which showed hypoattenuation in the posterior right external capsule at the area of stroke seen on followup diffusion weighted imaging .
MRI of the head showed an area of infarct in the right dorsal _______ extending into the posterior rim of the right internal capsule consistent with acute ischemic event .
MRA of the neck showed moderate narrowing of the left proximal subclavian artery .
MRA of the head showed no evidence of stenosis or aneurysm .
INVASIVE PROCEDURES :
The patient had a cerebral angiography .
The study demonstrates presence of lesion in the distal right M1 MCA proximal M2 division of the right cerebral artery producing 50% or less luminal reduction brain stenosis .
Given the abnormality was initially seen in the middle M1 MCA segment , this may be a thrombus with partial recanalization .
CARDIAC STUDIES :
The patient had a TTE which showed left ventricular function was normal .
Estimated ejection fraction of 60 to 65% .
No evidence of PFO .
STROKE MECHANISM :
Uncertain :
Small veseel lacunar infarction or middle cerebral artery atherosclerosis .
CONDITION ON TRANSFER :
Condition at discharge is stable .
The patient continues to have mild left - sided weakness , especially in the lower extremity .
DISPOSITION :
The patient will be discharged to Inpatient Rehabilitation as per PT / OT and PM&amp ; R evaluation .
TRANSFER / DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS :
1. Heparin drip which should be adjusted according to heparin nomogram .
2. Lipitor 80 mg p.o. , q. hour of sleep .
3. Coumadin 5 mg p.o. , daily .
4. Tylenol 650 mg p.o. , q. 6 hours , p.r.n. for pain and headache .
5. Pepcid 20 mg p.o. , q. 12 hours .
3. Aggrenox 1 capsule bid
LABS TO BE FOLLOWED :
The patient should have PT and INR starting on **DATE[Jun 19 2007] and then as directed for an INR goal of 2 to 3 .
The patient should also have PTT per the heparin nomogram .
It is also advised that the patient have LFT s in the next two weeks for monitoring of statin therapy .
INSTRUCTIONS :
The patient 's physical activity per PT / OT evaluation and treatment .
DIET :
The patient should be on a Heart Healthy Diet .
FOLLOWUP PLAN :
The patient should followup in the **INSTITUTION in four to six weeks .
Phone number is **PHONE .
The patient should also followup with PCP in one to two weeks , however , she states she does not have one currently .
She was advised to establish and see a PCP within the next one to two weeks and be advised that she stated that she had a suggestion from a neighbor of a possible PCP .
The signs and symptoms of stroke were reviewed with the patient and should any of these occur , she was told to report immediately to the emergency department for stroke risk management to maintain blood pressure between 120 to 130/80 .
Cholesterol management with an LDL goal of 100 or less .
Diabetes management with a hemoglobin A1C goal of less than or equal to 6 .
Given that the patient possibly has acute thrombus of intracranial vessels , the goal for warfarin therapy would be to maintain her INR between 2 to 3 .
Once fully therapeutic on the Coumadin , the patient may stop heparin drip .
