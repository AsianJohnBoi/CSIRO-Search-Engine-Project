I am seeing Mrs. **NAME[AAA] for critical care at the request of Dr. **NAME[YYY ZZZ] .
I have examined the patient , reviewed the medical record , including medications and laboratory data , and made adjustments to the patient 's therapy .
Ms. **NAME[AAA] is a **AGE[in 60s]- year - old woman with a history of bilateral lung reduction surgery who postoperatively has had respiratory failure , acute renal failure , cholelithiasis , and diverticulitis .
She has also had a deep venous thrombosis and an inferior venal caval filter put in place .
Today , the patient is afebrile .
Her mean pressures are between the mid - 50s and the mid - 60s .
Pulse is between 80 and 100 in sinus rhythm .
Respirations are between 15 and 25 , and she is on 40% oxygen and 93% saturated .
She is awake and alert .
Neurologically , she appears intact .
She is complaining of abdominal pain in the right upper quadrant .
She has a clean trach site .
Her dialysis catheter insertion site appears without inflammation .
She has diminished breath sounds bilaterally .
Her abdomen is distended slightly .
There are positive bowel sounds , and she has tenderness in the right upper quadrant without rebound or peritoneal signs .
She has edema which is reported to be improving .
Her I 's and O 's are positive 1 liter over the past 24 hours .
She is being treated with CVVHD and since midnight has had zero removal per hour because of hypotension .
She has been on and off of Levophed and is on a small dose of Levophed this morning .
I reviewed her medications .
I note that she is still on prednisone and has a history of a flat Cortrosyn stimulation test so I will continue that medicine .
She is well - dialyzed .
Her phosphate is low , and I am repleting that .
I believe that she is intravascularly depleted even though she has total body volume expanded .
I gave her 500 mL of Hextend , and with that , I was able to wean her off of the Levophed .
I spoke to Dr. **NAME[TTT] of Renal Medicine , and we have agreed to leave the patient 's fluid removal at 0 mL for the time being .
Should the blood pressure improve and she can stay off of Levophed for an extended period of time , we can continue trying to remove fluid from her later on today or , perhaps , tomorrow .
We have discontinued her vancomycin because her cultures are negative for Gram - positive cocci .
She has liquid stool so I have sent a Clostridium difficile culture .
Total time taken in the care of this critically ill patient is **AGE[in 30s] minutes .
