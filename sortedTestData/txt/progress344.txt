I am currently seeing this **AGE[in 50s]- year - old patient with prolonged ICU course , status post lung reduction surgery , complicated with a respiratory failure , now with respiratory insufficiency .
He has been off the vent now 36 hours , with hemodynamic instability on HD as well as hyperglycemic control and continuation of treatment for UTI and pneumonia .
I examined her , reviewed her laboratory data , chart data and chest x-ray .
She hemodynamically had been stable with no issues .
After going on hemodialysis , hypotensive , requiring Levophed at this point in time .
She is currently up to 0.1 Levophed with means running more in the mid 60s .
We will try to get her through dialysis and hopefully she should come off the Levophed once hemodialysis has been completed .
In light of this , it is probably very much unlikely to try to get volume off her today .
From a respiratory standpoint , as previously mentioned , she is clinically doing well .
She is off the vent for 36 hours and we will leave her off the vent as long as she tolerates .
She does continue on Cefepime to complete a course for E. coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae as well as Klebsiella and Pseudomonas UTI .
Her white count is 7.8 and she has been afebrile .
There does not appear to be any new infectious issues at this point in time .
She is in renal failure and no evidence of recovery , undergoing hemodialysis at this point in time .
She is on enteral nutritional support with TwoCal HN at 30 mL an hour , which she is tolerating .
Otherwise , for hyperglycemic control , blood sugars are still running a bit high , so I did increase her NPH .
She is on DVT and GI prophylaxis .
Otherwise at this point in time , we will continue her current supportive care and management .
CRITICAL CARE TIME EQUALS 32 MINUTES .
