I am currently continuing to see this **AGE[in 50s]- year - old lady status post lung reduction surgery , was found to have a tracheal tear initially postoperatively .
The patient continues to be managed for the current Critical Care issues .
1. Respiratory failure .
2. Pneumonia .
3. UTI .
4. Renal failure .
I examined her , reviewed her laboratory data and chart data .
Hemodynamically , she has remained hemodynamically stable .
She has been off of norepinephrine since yesterday afternoon , and means right now are running in the high 60s to high 70 mmHg range .
She is in a sinus rhythm to slow sinus tachycardia in the low 100s .
From a respiratory standpoint , he did not wean as well today .
She only did about an hour of trach mask trials .
She saturated to about 86% .
I did put her back on the vent .
A little bit tachypneic at this point in time as well .
Radiographically , chest x-ray is pretty much unchanged .
From an ID standpoint , she does have gram - negative rods , probably going to be Klebsiella which grew from her sputum and not yet identified out but , of note , that she has developed a generalized erythematous maculopapular rash which is pruritic in nature .
Most likely related to the cefepime .
So , I did discontinue the cefepime and started her on Azactam 1 gram every 12 , in light that the Klebsiella from her sputum culture is sensitive to Azactam .
Her urinary culture has come back positive for gram - negative rods times three different types .
The UA was also positive with 300 plus white cells .
She continues in renal failure , no evidence of recovery .
We will get hemodialysis today .
We will try to minimize her fluid level to about a Liter , and is tentatively schedule for her tunnel dialysis catheter will be Tuesday of this coming week .
She continues on enteral nutritional support with TwoCal HN which she is tolerating .
Her hematocrit has remained stable since she was transfused yesterday .
She went from 23 to 30 and was 28.5 this morning .
No evidence of bleeding .
Stool Hemoccult was negative .
So , to this point in time , we will continue to hold the subcutaneous heparin .
I do not think there is any indication to scope her at this point in time and follow her hematocrit closely .
Otherwise , her sugars are fairly well controlled on NPH 5 units twice a day .
We will , otherwise , continue her currently supportive care and management .
Critical Care time equals 31 minutes .
