I personally interviewed and examined the patient today .
The patient has marked improvement in his back pain , but he is on Dilaudid PCA pump .
He is getting fair amount of Dilaudid that is relieving his pain .
He is able to move around better in bed .
His abdominal pain is largely relieved .
He does not have any chest pain or shortness of breath .
Overall , he feels improved .
He denying any fevers or chills .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
On physical examination his vital signs were reviewed .
They are stable and normal .
He is in no acute distress .
His chest is clear except of decreased breath sounds at the bases .
Heart is regular , no murmurs .
Abdomen , there is no tenderness , masses , or hepatomegaly .
I cannot actually feel the spleen .
Extremities , there is no edema .
LABORATORY DATA :
I reviewed his MRI scan of lumbar spine .
This showed multiple wedge compression fractures involving L1 and L3 vertebral bodies .
There is fair amount of height loss of these vertebrae .
There is no significant discogenic disease .
The laboratory tests show normal electrolytes , BUN and creatinine , liver function tests are elevated but not different than usual and his white count is 3.6 from yesterday .
PROBLEMS :
1. Back pain .
This is most likely secondary to vertebral fractures .
We will continue him on current band regimens and will address whether any interventions can be done .
2. Abdominal pain .
This is improved .
We will continue him on current medications .
3. Liver disease .
At this time we will monitor him closely .
