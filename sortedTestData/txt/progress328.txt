EVALUATION DATE :
**DATE[Mar 27 07]
Mrs. **NAME[AAA] is a **AGE[in 60s]- year - old woman status post lung volume reduction surgery .
She continues to require critical care for management of her respiratory failure , acute renal failure , hyperglycemia , malnutrition , and deep venous thrombosis .
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN :
1. Pulmonary .
Respiratory failure following lung volume reduction surgery .
I am currently managing Mrs. **NAME[AAA] on assist - control ventilation rate of 14 , tidal volume 400 , 60% FiO2 and 5 of PEEP .
Chest x-ray is essentially unchanged today .
She has evidence of pulmonary edema which persists .
Breath sounds are equal in bilateral lung fields with occasional crackles and wheezes in the bases .
I will continue to wean her FiO2 as tolerated to maintain an oxygen saturation of greater than 92% .
Hemoptysis continues .
Bronchoscopy was performed today which shows left upper lobe ooze .
I suspect that her platelet dysfunction and uremia is contributing significantly to this .
I am hopeful that this will correct with hemodialysis .
2. Cardiovascular .
Extremities are warm and adequately perfused .
She is in a sinus rhythm with the means in the 60s to 80s .
Transthoracic echocardiogram today shows trivial pericardial effusion without evidence of echocardiographic tamponade .
LV function is preserved and there is moderately decreased right ventricular function .
She does have evidence on echocardiogram of volume overload consistent with a clinical examination .
3. Fluids , electrolytes and nutrition .
Sodium 133 , potassium 4.2 and magnesium 2.1 .
I have replaced electrolytes per protocol .
4. Infectious Disease .
Afebrile with a white count of 6.3 .
Erythema to the left lower extremity appears improved today .
Blood cultures are pending .
I will continue Zosyn at this time and dose with vancomycin following hemodialysis .
Cultures from her previous pigtail catheter have grown coag - negative staph .
I will consult infectious disease to assist with assessment of antibiotic duration .
Overtly she does not appear to be actively infected .
However , this is a culture from a presumably sterile body cavity .
She has had viridans grow from previous BAL s and one blood culture which was positive for viridan staph .
5. Endocrine .
Hyperglycemia .
I will continue sliding scale insulin coverage to maintain euglycemic control .
6. Renal .
Acute renal failure .
She is scheduled for hemodialysis today .
BUN is 111 with a creatinine of 4.8 .
7. GI .
Abdomen is soft and benign .
PEG tube is in place .
I will start tube feeds with TwoCal .
8. Hematology .
Hemoglobin this morning is 8.0 with a platelet count of 130 .
Heparin is currently on hold due to hemoptysis .
9. Prophylaxis .
I will continue a proton pump inhibitor .
Lower extremity duplexes are pending to assess for left lower extremity deep venous thrombosis .
She does have known right - sided DVT and is status post IVC filter placement .
I am concerned that her skin changes on the left are secondary possibly to deep venous thrombosis .
Critical Care time equals 32 minutes .
