**INSTITUTION COURSE :
Mr. **NAME[AAA] is a **AGE[in 50s]- year - old gentleman with a history of stage IV laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma diagnosed back in **DATE[Jul] of 2006 , who has been on experimental protocol consisting of cisplatin and ( _______________ ) weekly , who presents now with hypotension and anemia .
In talking with the patient , he had noticed on the day of admission , some light - headedness as well as some dizziness , some weakness and generalized fatigue .
The patient then subsequently did decide to seek medical attention for these problems .
Upon arrival in the emergency department , the patient was found to be hypotensive with a systolic blood pressure in the 70s and he was also found to be anemic with a hemoglobin of 8.7 , where previously approximately 5-6 days ago , he had had a hemoglobin of 12 .
The patient did then receive 2 units of blood as well as some IV fluids and was admitted .
The patient did respond to the IV fluids and his blood pressure did stabilize at a baseline for him which was around 90 to 100 systolic .
After the administration of 2 units of blood , the patient was largely asymptomatic and was no longer complaining of any dizziness , light - headedness or weakness .
The patient did ambulate appropriately and was thought suitable to be discharged to home .
The likely etiology of the patient 's anemia was a result of his chemotherapy that he receives on a weekly basis .
The patient was not complaining of any hematuria , hematemesis , hemoptysis , or melena or hematochezia .
Consequently , after having dealt with the patient 's hypotension and anemia , we did feel that the patient was suitable to be discharged to home .
In addition , we did administer the patient 's weekly dose of chemotherapy for treatment of his laryngeal cancer , and did instruct him to follow up with Dr. **NAME[WWW] at the **INSTITUTION per his regularly scheduled appointment .

8. MSIR 15 mg p.o. t.i.d.
9. Multivitamin 1 tablet p.o. daily .
DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS :
The patient 's condition at discharge is stable and his disposition was to home .
The patient was instructed to resume his normal activity level as he tolerated .
Of note , the patient did mention at the time of admission that he had been taking 2 medications , Lasix and diltiazem , which may have also contributed to his hypotension , and he was instructed to never take these medications again .
The patient will follow up with Dr. **NAME[WWW] in the **INSTITUTION next Tuesday as per his previously scheduled appointment .
