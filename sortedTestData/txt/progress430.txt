In the nursing home , she has had problems with decreased white count and mental status changes and was transferred to **INSTITUTION for further evaluation .
The patient has a history of anorexia that has been problem for her for greater than 20 years .
Her weight was down to 63 pounds at near when she was admitted to the **INSTITUTION .
She had a tube feed placed , but she pulled it out within 24 hours after having it placed despite having restraints , it was placed nasogastrically .
She was placed on Megace therapy and that she has been eating somewhat better .
During her stay there , apparently , she was started on multivitamin .
She had folate level that was normal , B12 level was normal , and TSH was normal .
I do not see that they gave her IV thiamine therapy .
When she was admitted to the **INSTITUTION , she also had issues with increase in BNP .
She had echocardiogram done there which revealed thickened mitral valve leaflets with moderate to severe mitral insufficiency .
She also had aortic valve sclerosis with mild to moderate aortic valve insufficiency .
She had mild pulmonic and moderate to severe tricuspid valve insufficiency with evidence of pulmonary hypertension .
She had evidence of biatrial enlargement but preserved LV function .
The patient was treated at **NAME[TTT SSS] 's with __________ therapy .
She was also treated for volume overload with diuresis .
They treated her for pneumonia , and she had received BiPAP therapy for 3 days .
She had wax and weaning mental status during her stay that seemed to be more prominent when she was hypoxic .
She was severely malnourished and debilitated , and she was transferred to the nursing home for further care .
Apparently , at the nursing home , she has had a lot of problems with her memory .
She is now started on Remeron and Zyprexa therapy at the nursing home and also Haldol recently .
She has had problems with her memory prior to admission to the hospital as well of son had to take care of her finances for a long time , and the patient was not really taking care of her ADLs and not cleaning her home for quite sometime .

2. Problem with COPD .
She uses BiPAP at night 10/5 , 2 L nasal cannula at baseline .
3. She has osteoporosis , chronic low back pain .
4. She has malnutrition and has a long history of anorexia .
SOCIAL HISTORY :
She has a history of having smoking .
She drinks occasional alcohol with just social events .
FAMILY HISTORY , REVIEW OF SYSTEMS , ALLERGIES , AND MEDICATIONS :
Please see the resident 's note in the chart .
My note should be considered linked to theirs .
On her review of systems when I talked with her son in addition to the resident 's review ; he states that she has been complaining of some lower abdominal discomfort for the last few months .
She states that it has been present since she had a fall approximately 3 months ago .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
Her blood pressure was 106/60 , pulse was 84 , temperature was 98 , respiratory was 18 , and O2 saturation was 94% on 4 L nasal cannula .
General Appearance :
She is alert .
She is not oriented to place .
She would like to get a ride to **PLACE as multiple people did drive her there .
She has offered people 25 to 50 dollars to take her there .
She is very anxious to leave the hospital .
On HEENT , oral mucosa was moist .
Her neck was supple .
I did not feel any concerning lymphadenopathy .
Her lungs are clear to auscultation and percussion .
Her heart had a normal S1 and S2 .
Despite her echocardiogram findings , I did not hear a murmur on her exam , but her exam was somewhat limited because she was agitated and did not really let me get her in the optimal position for complete cardiac exam .
Her abdomen was soft and nontender .
Again , she would not lie down to let me do a good abdominal exam for masses .
Her extremities are without edema .
Her neuro exam , she grossly does not appear to have focal neurologic abnormality .
She is walking without any unsteadiness of gait .
She was able to do tandem walking for my house staff which they stated was fairly normal , and Romberg was fairly normal .
She was agitated at this time and would not follow a detailed neurologic exam for me .
LABORATORIES :
On her laboratories , her sodium was 144 , BUN was 20 , creatinine was 0.8 , and bicarbonate was 32 .
Her gas revealed a pH of 7.36 , CO2 was 60 , and her O2 was 98 .
She was 96% saturated on that gas .
She had a CT scan done of her chest today which was a noncontrasted study .
It revealed severe emphysema and multiple pulmonary nodules .
This was compared with her previous EKG , and I called the Radiology , and they thought that she had more nodules on this exam compared to that one she had on **DATE[Jun 30 2007] .
She had a CT of her head which was read as age appropriate ventricle size and minimal ischemic changes in the paraventricular white matter regions .
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN :
1. COPD .
At this point , it seems to be stable .
I do not think that this is the cause of her current mental status changes .
We will keep her on Combivent and DuoNeb .
2. Anorexia , plan to give her supplements .
She has **NAME[RRR QQQ] shakes written for with her meals .
She will be continued on Megace therapy at this point .
3. Pulmonary nodules .
I talked with Radiology .
They thought that these were more likely to be inflammatory and may be related to recent pneumonia , but she does not have any evidence of pneumonia at this time .
We will follow serial exams .
We did a breast exam today and there were no prominent masses or bony retraction .
She will get a CT scan of her abdomen and pelvis to rule out any mass or lesions there , and if that is negative , she will have a followup CT of her chest in approximately 2 months to reevaluate these nodules .
Given her mental status changes and pulmonary nodules , we will check an MRI of her brain to rule out any evidence of mass or lesions in her brain .
4. Mental status changes .
It seems that she has a component of dementia based on her history and is having significant difficulty related to that .
We had Psychiatry to see her .
They made some medication adjustments , and once we do some further scanning , we will have her go to Geriatric Psych Unit for further titration of her medications to trying help her mental status .
Her case was discussed in detail with house staff .
I agree with their note as written .
My note should be considered linked to theirs .
