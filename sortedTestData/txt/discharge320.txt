According to the patient , he states that he has a history of CHF , chronic renal insufficiency , atrial fibrillation and had previously had a mitral valve replacement as well as a diagnosed 4 - cm AAA .
He is currently complaining of right - sided flank pain .
The patient states that over the course of the day , prior to admission , he had right - sided flank pain radiating from the anterior part of his abdomen on the right side .
The patient denied that this was new in characteristic and it was crampy as well as causing significant discomfort .
During the course of the day , leading up to admission , he said that his pain had worsened , but he denied any fevers , chills , chest pain , shortness of breath , nausea and vomiting , dysuria , hematuria , melena or hematochezia .
He did say that he had some degree of urinary hesitation , but that this is chronic in nature .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
While in the Emergency Department , he had initial laboratory work done , showing that he had 2 + leukocyte esterase as well as 598 urine white blood cells .
Moreover , it was seen that he had a moderate amount of urine bacteria and that there was a moderate amount of white blood cell clumping .
Given his overall laboratory work as well as his current symptoms , he was treated empirically with the diagnosis of a urinary tract infection versus pyelonephritis .
While he was in the Emergency Department , he received a dose of ciprofloxacin 400 mg IV times one .
Upon transfer to the floor , he had a Foley catheter placed and significant diuresis was noted .
In total , the patient appeared to diurese approximately 2000 mL of urine over the course of his first 18 hours at this facility .
On the day following admission , he was started on antimicrobial therapy with moxifloxacin 400 mg p.o. every day .
In evaluating his overall clinical course , it was noted that his creatinine improved significantly , from a value initially of 1.9 to an ultimate value of 1.4 at the time of transfer .
The other major issue regarding this patient 's overall clinical situation is that of deconditioning .
On the day of planned transfer to the Transitional Care Unit , he was evaluated by both PT and OT .
It was their recommendation that he receive some amount of subacute rehab care .
Per their evaluation , he will likely need several days in a skilled nursing facility where he can receive rehabilitation in order to return him to his baseline level of function .
While he is in this facility , he will continue to receive antimicrobial therapy with moxifloxacin 400 mg p.o. every day so that he receives a total of 10 days on this medication .
