**DATE[Feb 31 07]
I evaluated Mrs. **NAME[AAA] this afternoon for respiratory failure .
This morning , she was on assist control ventilation rate of 14 , tidal volume 350 , 40% FiO2 , and 2.5 of PEEP .
The chest tube continues to have a modest air leak with a right apical pneumothorax on chest x-ray .
There is no significant bronchospasm , though she is slightly tachycardic .
I will change her DuoNeb to Xopenex and continue her prednisone and theophylline for her bronchospasm .
She was able to tolerate CPAP with a pressure support of 15 this morning .
I placed her on a pressure support of 5 and obtained a venous gas an hour later .
She was not showing any clinical signs of CO2 retention , nor was she acidotic .
I will go ahead and proceed to extubation this afternoon .
Both her family and the patient understand that she is high risk for requiring reintubation due to her poor pulmonary mechanics .
Should she decompensate this evening , I would try a low level of BiPAP with an IPAP of 8 and EPAP of 5 and continue to wean her FiO2 as tolerated to maintain an oxygen saturation between 88 and 90 .
I have started a low dose of Cardizem for rate control for her atrial fibrillation .
Subcutaneous emphysema is mildly worse and the chest tubes were returned to suction today .
If Mrs. **NAME[AAA] does require reintubation , I will proceed with fiberoptic intubation given her recent tracheal injury .
Critical care time equals 45 minutes in addition to services provided earlier today .
