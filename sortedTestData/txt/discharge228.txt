**INSTITUTION :
Mrs. **NAME[AAA] is an **AGE[in 80s]- year - old white female followed by Dr. **NAME[UUU] at Classic Care , who currently resides at Amber Wood Assisted Living and she was brought in to the emergency room on **DATE[Nov 21 2007] , after she had fallen .
The patient was confused initially .
She had diagnostic studies undertaken , which revealed multiple thoracic and lumbar compression fractures .
It was noted that the lumbar compression fractures were reported even on previous x-rays from 2006 ; however , no T-spine imaging had been done at that time and the age of the current thoracic fracture is indeterminate .
**PLACE Orthopedics was consulted and the patient was thought to be not a candidate for kyphoplasty because of the multiple level involvement .
During the stay in the hospital , the patient 's pain medicines were adjusted .
She was placed on round - the - clock Tylenol along with Miacalcin nasal spray .
She was also placed on oxycodone on a p.r.n. basis , which was subsequently made into a morning routine dosing prior to her a.m. care .
Her usage of oxycodone on an average was between 2 to 3 per day .
During the course of her stay , her pain continued to improve ; however , did not completely resolve at the time of discharge .
She did still complain of pain with movement .
Her ambulatory status had declined significantly during this hospitalization most likely related to pain control issues .
At discharge , she was ambulating 5 to 7 feet in her room with the use of a Rolator and was requiring moderate assistance with bed transfers .
Her cardiac status remained stable .
She does carry a diagnosis of tachy-brady syndrome , but overall this remains stable .
The patient 's blood pressures have been fairly well controlled on an outpatient basis .
However , she was noted to have high blood pressure during the course of her hospitalization , which was thought to be again possibility related to her pain .
She did receive a dose of metoprolol and an extra 5 mg dose of the lisinopril during her stay .
We will place her back on her usual antihypertensive doses and monitor her blood pressures at the SNF that she will be transferring to .
The patient is noted to have osteoporosis on her x-rays .
Even though she has not had a DEXA scan , the x-rays as well as the history of multiple compression fractures is all indicative of the underlying osteoporosis .
Bisphosphonates were discussed with her power of attorney .
However , the patient does have underlying GERD and has had bleeding peptic ulcers in the past , which may prevent tolerability to the bisphosphonates .
A 25 - hydroxy vitamin D level will be checked .
The patient 's calcium and vitamin D was increased to twice a day to get her pills to her recommended requirements of 1500 mg of calcium and 800 international units of vitamin D daily .
The patient also had a low potassium of 3.0 , which was replaced .
She also had a low magnesium of 1.6 , which is currently getting replaced .

The patient 's niece has noted history of delirium in the past with hospitalizations .
The patient also exhibits some cognitive impairment ; however , a formal mini-mental has not been conducted on her yet .
The patient 's niece , Mrs. **NAME[CCC] was kept updated throughout the course of the hospitalization .
The patient was initially desirous of transferring to Harmar Village under Dr. **NAME[UUU] 's care ; however , secondary to lack of bed availability there , she will go to the Willows of **INSTITUTION Senior Care , and will be followed by Dr. **NAME[RRR] and Dr. **NAME[XXX] with ultimate discharge to Amber Woods after she is done with her SNF stay and subsequent followup with Dr. **NAME[UUU] at Classic Care .
