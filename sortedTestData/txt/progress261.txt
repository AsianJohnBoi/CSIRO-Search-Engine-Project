EVALUATION DATE :

SUBJECTIVE :
The patient is doing well today .
She seems to be improving .
She went for replacement of her feeding tube and tolerated that procedure very well .
She has no current complaints of chest pain , shortness of breath , nausea or vomiting .
She still does have some crampy lower bilateral abdominal pain that she attributes to gas .
She has only had one small bowel movement yesterday and today .
OBJECTIVE :
Vital Signs :
Currently stable .
Cardiac :
Normal S1 , S2 .
No murmurs , rubs , or gallops are present .
Lungs :
Clear to auscultation bilaterally .
Abdomen :
Slightly distended with gas and tympanitic .
Normoactive bowel sounds are present .
Essentially minimally tender on the right lower quadrant to deep palpation .
LABORATORY DATA :
Chem-7 is normal .
Blood sugars are ranging between 100 and 230 .
Transaminases are normal .
Obstructive enzymes are up slightly with an alkaline phosphatase of 523 and a GGTP of 207 .
White count and differential is normal .
H and H are 9.6 and 28.0 .
INR is 1.2 .
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN :
This is a **AGE[in 60s]- year - old female patient who is transferred to our facility from an outside hospital after having multiple complications following multi-stent placement for CAD .
1. Cardiac .
Status post multiple stents with history of acute instant thrombosis and removal of clot with AngioJet .
Continue aspirin and Plavix for now .
Continue other cardiac medications for now this time as well for treatment of her hypertension and hypercholesterolemia .
2. History of postoperative complications with pancreatitis and significantly large pancreatic pseudocyst causing gastric outlet obstruction .
GI Nutrition input is appreciated .
The patient 's GJ tube has been replaced , and she seemed to tolerate the procedure well .
We will resume aggressive nutritional supplementation for her at this point since she is significantly malnourished .
I would monitor her albumin once weekly , likely that we will continue benign intervention for the patient 's pseudocyst for now .
GI Surgery is aware of this patient 's case , but again , we are treating her nonoperatively at this point .
a. Also the patient had clean-based ulcers that were seen the first time that the GI Nutrition placed a tube and therefore she was felt at that time to be a contraindication for anticoagulation ( see below ) .
However , at this time , they feel that she is okay to be anticoagulated despite the fact that she has peptic ulcer disease with likely recent bleed .
3. Heme .
The patient has a thrombosed internal jugular vein ; currently on aspirin and Plavix .
We will continue Lovenox for now and monitor her H and H very carefully .
4. Normocytic anemia , likely due to anemia of chronic disease and possible subacute bleed component .
We will continue to monitor for now .
There is no clear indication for transfusion at this time .
5. Status post respiratory failure with trach in place .
Continue to downsize the trach , and we will try to obtain a Passy-Muir valve for communication purposes .
6. Infectious disease .
Continue Flagyl for C. difficile colitis and monitor abdominal status .
She does have some gas for now .
She is having small bowel movements .
We will follow abdominal flat plates as necessary in this patient to make sure that she has no colonic pseudoobstruction secondary to her C. difficile .
