ADDENDUM :
The new date of transfer for this patient will be **DATE[Jun 20 2007] .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
On the afternoon of **DATE[Jun 19 2007] , just prior to the patient 's transfer to rehabilitation , she suffered a period of waxing and waning in her neurological examination where she had some left upper and lower extremity weakness as well as some dysarthric speech .
This lasted for several minutes .
In response to this , although we checked the patient 's laboratory studies and her most recent PTT was therapeutic and satisfactory in the 50s , although starting Coumadin she was not fully therapeutic with an INR of 1.1 .
In this setting , with the knowledge that the patient had a partial thrombus in her proximal right middle cerebral artery , we ordered a STAT MRI / MRA subacute stroke protocol to evaluate the status to see if there was any intervention that would be required .
This was performed and the MRI / MRA reviewed , and there is no change in the studies with no extension of the stroke and no clear changes in the vessels .
In this setting , we continued the patient 's maximal medical management for this thrombus and with heparin drip bridging her to therapeutic Coumadin and felt that the patient was in stable condition .
She was seen on the morning of **DATE[Jun 20 2007] .
She had stable vital signs .
She was doing well .
She was back to her baseline and in good spirits , looking forward to participating in rehabilitation .
In this setting , she was felt to be medically clear for transfer to Rehabilitation as soon as possible .

There is no change to the followup instructions .
