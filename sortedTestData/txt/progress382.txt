Impression
**AGE[in 70s] yo male admitted after syncopal episode found to have ulcerated duodenal lipoma , s/p endoscopic ligation .
Plan
1. GI - H/O duodenal ulcer .
Prevacid stopped 2-3 weeks ago by pt.
Heme + stool in ED .

The lipoma should auto - amputate secondary to ischemic necrosis with time .
Will plan for repeat EGD in 2 months .
Pt resumed diet without difficulty .
Pt. denies any bleeding .
2. Heme - H/H decreased to 8.4/24.6 .
As per attending , will transfuse to keep hematocrit &gt ; 30 .
