**DATE[Dec 14 07]
I am managing this critically - ill **AGE[in 40s]- year - old male with severe pancreatitis and multiple complications , which have been documented previously in the medical record .
I am seeing this patient for management of his hypotension , sepsis , respiratory failure , and his pancreatitis .
I have seen and examined the patient , reviewed his laboratory , radiographic , and Emtek data and discussed the management with the general surgeons , vascular surgeons , and the hepatic surgeons .
Problems and management are as follows :
1. Respiratory failure .
Chest x-ray shows an increase in his bilateral infiltrates consistent with ARDS .
On the vent , I have him on assist-control .
He developed some air hunger last night when I dropped his tidal volume from 450 to 350 and his tidal volume had been increased over the evening .
I would like to keep his tidal volume at 350 , to keep his plateau pressures low , and consistent with a 6 mL / kg .
To that end , I have increased his sedation today and dropped his tidal volumes to 350 .
He seems to be doing reasonably well .
Gas exchange is moderately impaired at 50% FiO2 and 12 of PEEP .
I will do bronchoscopy today to evaluate the ARDS and to rule out a possible pneumonia as a cause of his sepsis .
2. Sepsis .
White blood cell count is dropping today to 5000 , which is consistent with his previous septic episodes as well .
I have him on broad-spectrum gram negative and gram positive coverage including colistin for his multidrug resistant Pseudomonas , as well as tigecycline for extended gram positive coverage , as well as good gram negative and anaerobic coverage for possible intraabdominal abscess .
He did go down for a PTC catheter today , and he has done clinically well after that with a reasonable amount of drainage in the bag .
He has become somewhat more septic after his PTC catheter with peripheral vasodilation , hypotension , and overall sepsis physiology .
He is not responding to fluid resuscitation , and I have started him on a norepinephrine infusion , titrated for a mean arterial pressure of
65 .
3. ICU prophylaxis .
He has stress ulcer and DVT prophylaxis .
I have held off on resuming his tube feeds for another 24 hours in light of his worsening sepsis today .
TOTAL CRITICAL CARE TIME EQUALS 40 MINUTES EXCLUDING PROCEDURES .
PROCEDURE NOTE :
Bronchoscopy .
INDICATIONS :
Respiratory failure / ARDS .
DESCRIPTION :
The patient is sedated Versed and vecuronium .
The fiberoptic bronchoscope was inserted through the endotracheal tube and advanced into the airway .
Evaluation of the right upper , right middle , and right lower lobe , as well as the left upper , left lingula , and left lower lobe are essentially unremarkable .
CT scan of the chest revealed significant involvement in the superior segments of the bilateral left lower lobes .
In light of this finding , I have wedged the bronchoscope in the superior segments of the right upper lobe and instilled 120 mL or sterile normal saline into two 60 mL _________ with a return of about 40 mL of aspirate .
I sent this off to the microbiology laboratory for evaluation .
The patient tolerated the procedure well .
I was present for and supervised the entire procedure .
PROCEDURE NOTE :
Femoral arterial line .
INDICATIONS :
Hypotension .
DESCRIPTION :
The patient 's left groin is prepped times two minutes of Chlorhexidine , full sterile barriers are applied including hat , mask , gown , glove , and large sterile drape .
The left femoral artery was accessed on the second pass with a needle .
The wire and 5 - French catheter advanced using Selinger technique without complications .
Sutured into place .
I was present for and supervised the entire procedure .
