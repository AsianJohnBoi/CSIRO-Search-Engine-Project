ATTENDING PHYSICIAN :
**NAME[YYY M ZZZ]
ADMISSION DATE :
**DATE[Mar 08 2007]
DISCHARGE DATE :
**DATE[Mar 15 2007]
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
Atrial fibrillation .
REASON FOR ADMISSION :
This patient has had a history of atrial fibrillation which was initially diagnosed in 2001 .
He has undergone previous DC cardioversions and has been managed in the past on flecainide , digoxin , and Rythmol .
After his cardioversion in **DATE[Sep 2006] , he reverted back to atrial fibrillation and flecainide was restarted .
He remained on flecainide and digoxin up until this hospitalization because of his recurrent episodes of atrial fibrillation .
When in this arrhythmia , he feels warm and clammy , sometimes diaphoretic , shortness of breath , and palpitations .
He admits to times of felling near syncopal .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient initially was admitted to the Cath Lab holding area .
He was then underwent a transesophageal echocardiogram .
This showed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 60% to 65% , a nondilated left ventricle , and no clots or spontaneous contrast in the left atrial appendage .
A CT scan of the chest at that time as well showed normal pulmonary vein anatomy , moderately elevated calcium scores , and moderate atherosclerosis with CAD with a long noncalcified plaque proximal to mid LAD causing mild - to - moderate narrowing .
A large calcified plaque was identified in the mid LAD .
The following day he underwent a radiofrequency catheter ablation of posterior left atrium for his atrial fibrillation .
The procedure without incident , and the specifics are well documented in the operative note , which will be provided under separate cover .
His postextubation period was evident for thick brown sputum with some moderate decrease in his O2 saturations .
His chest x-ray at that time showed that the right lung was diffusely hazy .
We suspected aspiration or a chemical pneumonitis .
At that point , he was given incentive spirometry and pulmonary toilet .
No antibiotics were started .
A noncontrast CT of the chest was done the day after , which showed patchy consolidation in all lobes of both lungs , which apparently was consistent with aspiration .
There was no evidence for pulmonary edema; however , the CT scan identified small bilateral pleural effusions and coronary calcifications .
Based on the results of both the CT scans , we discontinued his flecainide in the light of possible coronary artery disease .
We felt that he likely had chemical pneumonitis as the result of the general anesthesia , intubation , and ablation procedure .
After reviewing the results of the CT scans , the following day he underwent an adenosine - thallium stress test .
This test documented a left ventricular ejection fraction of 61% ; normal left ventricular wall motion ; no significant associated ST segment abnormalities ; no arrhythmias ; and no significant ischemia .
His postprocedural transthoracic echocardiogram showed no evidence for a pericardial effusion .
He remained in a normal sinus rhythm throughout his hospital stay off flecainide and Lanoxin and remained in the hospital until his INR was therapeutic .
He was discharged to home on **DATE[Mar 15 2007] , with an INR of 2.0 .
He was seen by Dr. **NAME[VVV] prior to his discharge who knows he had not been on Coumadin for about 10 years .
We sent him home with Coumadin 10 mg alternating with 15 mg of Coumadin as well as Ecotrin 325 mg .
LABORATORY DATA :
His lab work at discharge showed hematocrit of 31.4 , hemoglobin of 11.3 , WBC s 5.6 , and platelets were 256 .
His INR 2.0 on **DATE[Mar 15 2007] , and 1.4 on **DATE[Mar 14 2007] .
He will obtain a prothrombin time with INR 3 days after his hospital discharge .
The patient requested that Dr. **NAME[UUU TTT] , his primary care physician , manage his Coumadin therapy .
FOLLOWUP :
He will follow with Dr. **NAME[ZZZ] at the **INSTITUTION on **DATE[Apr 23 2007] .
He will follow with his primary care physician on **DATE[Mar 16 2007] , and he will follow as well with Dr. **NAME[SSS RRR] , his cardiologist , in 4 weeks .
