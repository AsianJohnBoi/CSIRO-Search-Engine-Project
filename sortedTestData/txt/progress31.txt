I am currently seeing this **AGE[in 70s]- year - old gentleman initially status post CABG , postop day number two .
Postop course has been complicated with initial respiratory , followed by cardiac arrest up on 6 D .
Currently I am managing his hemodynamics and inotropic support .
I examined him , reviewed his laboratory data , chart data , and chest x-ray .
Hemodynamically , the patient did undergo open chest arrest on the floor and went to the OR , was placed on a pump .
The vessels were found to be patent .
A balloon pump was placed , he came out open on 0.2 of " epi " and vasopressin at 0.02 mcg / kg / min .
Initial cardiac index was 1.8 .
Dopamine was started and index did improve .
" Epi " is now down to 0.075 mcg / kg / min .
Lactate continues to improve , now down to 6.4 .
Balloon remains in and was ________ at 1:1 .
So hemodynamically he currently is improving .
His issue at this point in time is neurologic .
This morning he started to have some twitching , initially appearing like it was mono clonus .
I did order a STAT EEG which did confirm burst suppression .
So the patient at this point is with a devastating neurologic injury , anoxic in nature .
I did discuss with the family concerning results of the EEG , that it did mean that he did have an extremely poor prognosis of recovery , but at this point in time we will give him a few more days and follow up on repeat EEG , and then assess at that point in time .
The patient 's family did express that if he was not going to neurologically recover , that they did not want to continue care , at that point in time they would like to make him comfort measures only .
Otherwise , from a ventilatory standpoint , his A-a gradient has improved .
He is down to 40% and he is on 5 of PEEP .
His sats are in the high 90s to 100% .
Otherwise , his hematocrit has been stable , no evidence of bleeding .
He did get some products this morning for an INR of 2 , ________  , some cryo , and some platelets for a platelet count of 63,000 .
INR is coming down , platelet count is improved .
In light of this , I did not transfuse any more products .
Will follow with repeat coags in the morning .
I did put him on prophylactic vancomycin in light his chest was open and he is on Protonix for GI prophylaxis .
So at this point in time , we have a gentleman , **AGE[in 70s] years of age , status post respiratory and cardiac arrest , now with anoxic brain injury with burst suppression and poor prognosis for any neurological recovery .
So , we will see what he does over the next 24 to 48 hours , although I think it is unlikely he is going to make any neurological recovery , reassess him and then discuss with the family where they want to proceed from that point on .
Otherwise , continue his current supportive care and management .
CRITICAL CARE TIME = 40 MINUTES .
