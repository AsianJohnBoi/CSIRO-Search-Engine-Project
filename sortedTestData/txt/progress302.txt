I have been requested by Dr. **NAME[ZZZ] to take care of this patient admitted to the ICU .
I am managing this patient 's respiratory failure , hyperglycemia , infectious disease , and electrolyte imbalances .
I have examined this patient , reviewed the data in the medical records , and looked at the most recent x-ray films .
This patient 's care has been provided under my direct supervision .
On my examination today , the patient is awake , seems to be following commands .
It looks like she may be a little bit confused and delirious .
Examination of the heart reveals S1 , S2 present .
The lungs revealed diminished breath sounds at both bases .
The abdomen is soft and nontender .
With regards to my assessment and plan for the day , I tried her on CPAP 5 , pressure support 5 .
Every time I tried her on minimal pressure support , the patient 's minute volume goes down to less than 5 liters , and she gets into moderate to severe respiratory acidosis with pH in the 7.15 to 7.25 range .
The PCO2 is in the high 70s to mid 80s .
I , hence , aborted that trial .
She also had increasing wheezing this morning for which she is on all her home medications including theophylline , p.o. prednisone and the IV hydrocortisone .
At the present time , the patient is quite not ready for extubation from a mechanical standpoint of view ; however , she has been off her __________ gas insufflation .
I have left her on CPAP at the pressure support of anywhere from 12-15 with which her ventilation seems to be adequate .
Her air leak has not gotten better .
The x-ray looks nicely expanded .
I have continued an insulin infusion on her along with the Unasyn she is on empirically after the __________ tear .
I have replaced her electrolytes appropriately .
The total critical care time I provided on this patient is **AGE[in 30s] minutes .
