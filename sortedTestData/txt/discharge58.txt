HISTORY AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
Mr. **NAME[BBB AAA] is a very pleasant **AGE[in 50s]- year - old gentleman with a recent diagnosis of deep venous thrombosis and with a known history of invasive bladder cancer who presented for elective inferior vena cava disruption and elective cystoprostatectomy with neobladder reconstruction .
Mr. **NAME[AAA] was diagnosed with bladder cancer in **DATE[Jul 2007] .
He , initially , presented for evaluation of severe flank pain .
He was found to have a ureteral obstruction and a nephrostomy tube was placed .
He underwent a TURBT , establishing the diagnosis of bladder cancer .
He was treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy at an outside institution .
Radical cystoprostatectomy was recommended .
On physical examination , his temperature was 36.4 .
His pulse was 85 .
His respiratory rate was 20 .
Blood pressure was 114/16 .
In general , he was an alert 55 gentleman , comfortable lying in bed .
His heart had a regular rate and rhythm and his lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally with no adventitious wheezes , rales , or rhonchi .
His abdomen was soft , nontender , and nondistended with a right nephrostomy tube in place .
His extremities were without cyanosis , clubbing , or edema .
His admission laboratory values were significant for a BUN of 18 and a creatinine of 1.0 and a white count of 11.1 .
Upon admission , his PT was 10.5 ; his PTT was 28 ; and INR was 1.1 .
COURSE :
Mr. **NAME[AAA] was started on prednisone before admission because of an allergy to contrast dye .
On **DATE[Dec 16 2007] , he was taken to interventional radiology , where he had an inferior vena cava filter placed .
This procedure occurred without complication .
Afterwards , he was transferred to the floor .
On **DATE[Dec 20 2007] , Mr. **NAME[AAA] underwent a radical cystoprostatectomy with creation of an ileal orthotopic neobladder under general anesthesia .
He tolerated this procedure well and without complication .
Afterwards , he was taken to the recovery room for a short time and then transferred to the floor where he stayed for the remainder of his hospitalization .
Mr. **NAME[AAA] 's hospital course was complicated by a partial small bowel obstruction .
On postoperative day #3 , the NG tube was removed and the plan was to await for the return of bowel function .
After approximately 1 week , a consultation to Dr. **NAME[TTT VVV] was made for a surgical evaluation of partial small bowel obstruction .
On **DATE[Jan 1 2008] , Mr. **NAME[AAA] had CT of the abdomen and pelvis without IV and without oral contrast that demonstrated a partial small bowel obstruction that was likely mechanical from adhesions , so **NAME[AAA] was kept NPO and intravenous TPN was given for nutritional support .
His TPN was initially not cycled and that was cycled down to 16 hours at the time of discharge .
Multiple flat plates of the abdomen demonstrated air - fluid levels consistent with partial small bowel obstruction .
There was a decision to do an upper GI series with a small bowel followthrough according to Dr. **NAME[VVV] .
However , Mr. **NAME[AAA] had evidence of returned bowel function with the passage of flatus and bowel movements .
However , at the time of discharge , he still had an NPO status , although he was passing flatus and small bowel movements .
A consultation to Dr. **NAME[UUU] was made in regards to Dr. **NAME[AAA] 's anticoagulation .

Dr. **NAME[UUU] 's service was called again , and their recommendation was to give him double his normal daily dose on **DATE[Jan 7 2008] , with a close watch on his coagulation status after discharge .
Throughout the course of his stay , Mr. **NAME[AAA] maintained an urine output greater than 0.5 mL / kg / hour .
His neobladder was irrigated daily .
His IV fluids were adjusted with his TPN to give him maintenance rate to maintain an euvolemic status .
Throughout the course of his stay , he remained afebrile and normotensive .
Initially , his pain was managed with intravenous narcotics .
He was gradually switched to oral narcotics and oral antiinflammatories .
