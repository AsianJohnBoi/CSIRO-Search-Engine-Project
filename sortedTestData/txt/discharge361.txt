ATTENDING PHYSICIAN :
**NAME[YYY M ZZZ]
ADMISSION DATE :
**DATE[Sep 11 2007]
DISCHARGE DATE :
**DATE[Sep 25 2007]
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS ( ES ) :
OSTEOMYELITIS OF THE PUBIC SYMPHYSIS .
SECONDARY DIAGNOSIS ( ES ):
1. STATUS POST GUNSHOT WOUND IN 1996 RESULTING IN A T9-T11 SPINAL CORD TRANSSECTION .
2. STATUS POST ELECTIVE END - COLOSTOMY .
3. HISTORY OF HEMORRHAGIC OVARIAN CYST .
4. CHRONIC STAGE IV DECUBITUS ULCER OF THE LEFT BUTTOCK .
STUDIES :
1. **PLACE , PA and lateral reviews obtained **DATE[Sep 12 2007] , which revealed clear lungs , normal cardiovascular and pleural cavity structures and multiple metallic foreign bodies in the mid lower chest .
2. Total body bone scan performed **DATE[Sep 12 2007] , which revealed findings suggestive of osteomyelitis of the medial portions of the bilateral pubic bones in the region of the symphysis grossly unchanged from a previous exam dated **DATE[Jun 31 07] and increased uptake within the left sacroiliac joint and lower thoracic vertebrae , which is grossly unchanged from the previous exam .
3. Radiograph of the pelvis , AP view performed **DATE[Sep 14 2007] , which revealed no change in the appearance of the destructive changes of the symphysis pubis and ischial tuberosities presumably related to osteomyelitis and decubitus disease when compared with a previous exam from **DATE[Jun 29 2007] .
4. CT of the pelvis with contrast performed **DATE[Sep 14 2007] , which revealed findings most likely consistent with septic arthritis and osteomyelitis of the symphysis pubis and of the dorsal caudal sacrum , left gluteal decubitus ulcer with extension into the caudal sacrum and a ventral hernia containing non - dilated loops of bowel .
PROCEDURES :
CT guided bone biopsy performed **DATE[Sep 17 2007] .
Under CT guidance , an 18 - gauge 3 1/2 inch spinal needle was advanced to the symphysis pubis .
2 biopsy samples were obtained , one of the bone marrow and one of the fluid collection of the symphysis pubis .
Bone marrow had a bloody appearance while the fluid collection of the symphysis pubis was purulent .
These 2 samples were followed by a bone biopsy .
This was performed using an 18 - gauge bone biopsy needle .
Under CT guidance , the needle was advanced into the right symphysis pubis .
A bone sample was obtained and sent for culture .
The procedure was without complications and the patient tolerated the procedure well .
REASON FOR ADMISSION :
This is a **AGE[in 30s]- year - old female , status post gunshot wound to the spine in 1996 with T9-T11 transsection and residual quadriplegia and a history of recurrent osteomyelitis of the symphysis pubis who was recently treated in **DATE[Jun] and early **DATE[Jul] of 2006 for osteomyelitis who presented to her PCP 's office for routine follow up .
At this visit she was found to have a white blood count of 12.6 and an elevated ESR of 115 .
The patient was also noted to be tachycardiac and was found to have a low - grade fever .
The patient was admitted for work - up of possible recurrence of her osteomyelitis .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
1. Osteomyelitis .
Since the patient had previously underwent a course of treatment with vancomycin , Cipro and Flagyl , we elected to initially hold off on IV antibiotics until we determined the source of the patient 's infection .
We proceeded to evaluate recurrence of osteomyelitis as a reason for the patient 's findings .
Repeat imaging suggested that the patient did indeed have a recurrence of her osteomyelitis .
Previously the patient 's bone culture had grown prepatella .
We did obtain an Infectious Disease consult who recommended a repeat bone biopsy considering that the patient should have had an adequate course and it was not clear exactly what the antibiotic sensitivities of the current organism would be .
Additionally , the patient 's bone biopsy grew Group G Strep as well as proteus .
At this point , the recommendation from Infectious Disease was to treat the patient with high dose continuous infusion vancomycin .
We loaded the patient with 2 grams of vancomycin and then began a 4 gram per 24 hour vancomycin continuous infusion .
Intravenous Moxifloxacin was also added with the hopes of eventually transitioning the patient to oral Moxifloxacin .
Eventually the bone culture did begin to grow prepatella as well , which was the original organism identified previously in **DATE[Jun] .
We discussed the case extensively with the Infectious Disease Team .
They felt that Moxifloxacin would be the ideal therapy in this case .
However , the Streptococcus was Cipro intermediate .
They performed additional MIC testing for Moxifloxacin to determine whether this antibiotic could be used and also if it could be safely administered in p.o. form rather than IV form .
A MIC of Moxifloxacin was obtained at 0.25 .
This was deemed adequate for continuing the patient on p.o. Moxifloxacin as we felt that this MIC indicated that the p.o. form would provide adequate killing .
To maximize absorption and bioavailability of Moxifloxacin , the patient was counseled to avoid antacids , milk , dairy products , vitamins , zinc and iron tablets 2 hours before and after taking the
Moxifloxacin .
The patient was to have weekly Chem-7 s , CBC s and ESR s drawn and faxed to the **INSTITUTION .
The patient is to have follow - up with Dr. **NAME[TTT] and Dr. **NAME[SSS RRR] , the Infectious Disease fellow , in 6 weeks .
The patient 's Moxifloxacin course is scheduled to end **DATE[Nov 9 2007] .
2. Vaginal discharge .
The patient complained of unusual vaginal discharge while an inpatient .
A pelvic exam was performed in the **INSTITUTION .
The patient appeared to have a small urethral polyp .
There was no evidence of fistulous tracking , however , the patient was on her period and a KOH wet prep was not able to be performed .
We did treat the patient empirically with MetroGel for bacterial vaginosis .
The patient is to have outpatient follow - up at the **INSTITUTION in **NAME[QQQ] .
3. Pain control .
The patient continued to have significant problems with her chronic pain from her osteomyelitis .
She was briefly on a Dilaudid PCA , which seemed to be working well for her .
We transitioned her to p.o. Dilaudid , which continued to work well .
Considering the patient 's high pain medication needs , we obtained a Pain Consult to have the patient be seen as an outpatient for management of her chronic pain .
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS :
1. Baclofen 30 mg p.o. t.i.d.
2. Flexeril 5 mg p.o. t.i.d.
3. Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.
4. Ferrous gluconate 300 mg p.o. t.i.d. with meals .
5. MS Contin 30 mg p.o. b.i.d.
6. Moxifloxacin 400 mg p.o. daily for 6 weeks to end on **DATE[Nov 9 2007] .
7. Senna 2 tabs p.o. at bedtime .
8. Prevacid 30 mg p.o. daily .
DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS :
1. Disposition :
The patient was discharged to home .
2. Condition :
The patient 's condition on discharge was good .
3. Diet :
The patient is to have the following dietary restrictions :
She is to avoid antacids , milk , dairy products , vitamins , zinc and iron tablets 2 hours before and 2 hours after taking Moxafloxacin .
