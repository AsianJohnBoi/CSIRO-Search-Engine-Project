HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
I am seeing this **AGE[in 60s]- year - old lady status post bilateral lung reduction surgery for ________________________ .
She hemodynamically has remained stable .
No issues .
Her hematocrit has remained stable .
No evidence of bleeding as well over the course of the last 24 hours .
She had a total of 3 units packed RBC 's yesterday .
Unsure where the blood lost came from , CT scan was unrevealing of both the chest and abdomen .
From a respiratory standpoint , she continues to improve .
She is now no trach mask weaning trials .
We will keep her on trach mask today , but will not let her go overnight , in light that she did clearly desaturate to 78% on a weaning trial yesterday evening .
From a renal electrolytes standpoint , she is in renal failure .
There is no evidence of recovery .
We will try to get her dialyzed with intermittent hemodialysis today .
If she tolerates this , she will continue hemodialysis intermittent and will talk to Renal about getting a tunnel catheter in her as well .
From an ID standpoint , her white count is normal .
She is afebrile .
She did have a urine culture come back greater than 100,000 colonies of yeast .
We will change out her Foley and repeat a U / A , this time , as well as , a urine C&amp ; S .
She also had a tracheal aspirate done on Friday which just came back revealing many gram - negative rods and a gram - stain , unsure what to make of this as well .
There were no distinct infiltrates on the CT scan .
She is hemodynamically stable .
She is afebrile .
White count is normal and she is weaning from the vent .
No clinical indications that she has pneumonia at this point and time .
So I do not think at this point and time that there is any need to start any antibiotics .
Otherwise , she is on Enteral nutritional support which she has been tolerating .
We will continue to hold her subcu. heparin for another 24 to 48 hours and follow her creat to make sure that it remains stable .
Of note , she does have a lower extremity DVT , does have an IVC filter placed .
She is on GI prophylaxis .
We will otherwise continue her current supportive care and management .
