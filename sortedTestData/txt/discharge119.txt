HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient is a **AGE[in 70s]- year - old woman with a history of coronary artery disease and hypertension who presented to **INSTITUTION on **DATE[Jul 4 2007] , with complaints of a 40 - pound weight gain and increased peripheral edema .
At **INSTITUTION , she was found to be heart failure with severe mitral regurgitation and there was a question of possible vegetation seen on her mitral valve on TTE .
She also had developed a right leg ulcer which became open and was concerning for a possible infection for which they treated with Augmentin .
Due to the patient 's question of possible mitral valve seen on a TTE , she was then transferred to **INSTITUTION for further management on **DATE[Jul 7 2007] .
Past medical history :
1. Hypertension .
2. Four - vessel CABG .
3. Hyperlipidemia .
4. Hypothyroidism .
5. Diabetes .
6. History of heart failure .
Echocardiogram done in 1998 showed an EF of 30% .
The following echocardiogram done on **DATE[Jul 15 2004] , showed an EF of 65% .
7. History of peptic ulcer disease with a GI bleed in **DATE[Sep] of 2004 .
8. History of dementia .
9. History of osteoarthritis .
10. Status post cholecystectomy .
11. Status post hysterectomy .
Hospital course :
1. Heart failure .
The patient was re - evaluated with a TTE here at **INSTITUTION which showed LVH , EF of 55 to 60% with severe RV dysfunction .
She was also noted to have a thickened and restricted aortic valve , severe mitral regurgitation , severe tricuspid regurgitation , and a PA pressure of 56 mmHg .
She was then evaluated by cardiac surgery for possible mitral valve and tricuspid valve replacement .
However , a Euro risk score was calculated at 40% of perioperative mortality for Ms. **NAME[AAA] and she was deemed too medically unstable for surgery .
We initially attempted to diurese by using IV Lasix and she was started on milrinone to attempt to increase her cardiac output .
However , despite being on milrinone and IV Lasix , she continued to have very poor diuresis and she developed worsening acute renal failure .
Given her poor heart function , she was discontinued off the milrinone and IV Lasix and started on hemodialysis .
She was also discontinued off her home Diovan due to her acute renal failure .
The patient was later started on a heart failure regimen of hydralazine and isosorbide .
A repeat right heart catheterization on **DATE[Jul 18 2007] , showed no improvement of her PA pressures despite aggressive diuresis with hemodialysis .
Therefore , she remained an extremely poor surgical candidate and will only be medically managed .
We will continue her on aspirin , Lipitor , isosorbide , and hydralazine .
When she is more stable , we may consider starting an ACE inhibitor as an outpatient .
2. Renal .
The patient , upon admission to **INSTITUTION , had acute renal failure with creatinine of 2 .
Her renal function continued to worsen due to her poor cardiac output and she did require hemodialysis .
A tunneled dialysis catheter was inserted , and she will likely be maintained on hemodialysis indefinitely .
The patient was also started on Aranesp and IV iron for chronic anemia .
She will have outpatient hemodialysis every Monday , Wednesday , and Friday .
3. Diabetes .
The patient was discontinued off her home metformin and was started on glipizide 2.5 mg p.o. q. day .
Her glucose control was good throughout her hospitalization and she will be continued on glipizide as well as sliding scale insulin .
4. Hypothyroidism .
The patient will continue on Synthroid 300 micrograms p.o. q. day .
5. Wound care .
The patient had developed a blister on her right lower extremity due to her significant edema which then progressed to an ulcer .
She had been treated as an outpatient with Augmentin .
The wound was initially 11 x 10 cm in area ; however , it did not appear infection and antibiotics were discontinued .
She was continued on wound care , and upon discharge , her lower extremity ulcer had significantly improved to a size of 1 cm in diameter .
We will continue wound care for her right lower extremity wound as well as her coccyx sacral wound as an outpatient .
6. ID .
The patient was initially transferred to **INSTITUTION with concerns about possible vegetation in her mitral valve .
However , repeat TEE on **DATE[Jul 8 2007] , as well as **DATE[Jul 18 2007] , showed no signs of vegetation or thrombus .
She was discontinued off antibiotics upon admission and cultures have remained negative .
She has also remained afebrile throughout her hospitalization at **INSTITUTION .

The patient is to be transferred to **INSTITUTION for nursing home care .
