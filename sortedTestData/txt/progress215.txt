VENTILATOR MANAGEMENT NOTE :
I am managing this **AGE[in 60s]- year - old female with respiratory and renal failure after a sternal resection for mediastinitis .
On examination today , Mr. **NAME[AAA] is awake , alert , and oriented .
Yesterday she was able to go for about two hours on a moderate level of pressure support .
I rested her overnight on assist control .
Peak airway pressures were in the high 20s on a tidal volume of 500 .
Gas exchange is reasonable at 40% FiO2 and 7 1/2 of PEEP .
Chest x-ray shows some slight increase in bilateral effusions .
Today I changed her from assist control to 10 cm water pressure support over to 7 1/2 of PEEP .
She has been able to go for about three to four hours on that before becoming tachypneic with small tidal volumes and increased respiratory rate .
I rested her back on full support .
She continues to finish her current course of cefepime and vancomycin for her mediastinitis .
Clinically she is getting better .
White blood cell count is down to 12,000 .
She has been afebrile .
I have started her on a very low - dose of carvedilol in an effort to give her some beta blockade without dropping her blood pressure or her heart rate .
She is on intermittent hemodialysis on a Tuesday , Thursday , and Saturday schedule .
She was dialyzed yesterday with 2.1 liter ultrafiltration .
Her tunnel dialysis catheter is functioning well .
I have discontinued her femoral temporary dialysis line .
