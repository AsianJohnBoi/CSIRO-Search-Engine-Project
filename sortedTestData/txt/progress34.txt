He has a significant history of COPD .
I am planning to start him again on theophylline and also we will use albuterol , Atrovent , and if he requires steroids we will use that , however no need for it right now .
We will switch him to pressure support ventilation and will wean / titrate pressure support to keep his respiratory rate less than 20 .
Hopefully we will try him on tracheostomy mask later on today .
