I continue to see this patient because of chronic respiratory failure , failure to thrive , and failure to wean .
This patient 's chest x-ray this morning shows some worsening .
There is an increased pleural effusion on the right side .
The patient may need a new pigtail drain .
She also has more compromised mental status .
We will discontinue some of the sedation and allow this patient to wake up and be more interactive .
She is unable to wean because of prolonged ventilatory support .
She is anxious .
She is unable to come down off her pressure support even though at the present time there appears to be no evidence of infection .
However , this morning , for the first time in days , the white count has gone up to 32.6 .
On exam , she is awake , alert , and following commands .
She is complaining of mild abdominal pain .
I am concerned that she may be developing Clostridium difficile .
We will send this for culture .

If the patient has any signs of deterioration , we will obtain a CT of the abdomen today .
Her T-max is 37.9 .
She is on full ventilatory support .
