I am seeing this critically ill patient for continued management of multiple medical problems including respiratory failure and encephalopathy with alcohol withdrawal .
I have weaned his ventilator down to minimum support with CPAP and pressure support of 5 .
He tolerated this poorly early this morning , but later in the morning he was doing quite well and following commands , taking 800 to 1000 mL tidal volumes with being .
I have extubated him to a nasal cannula and he is maintaining sats in the high 90s .
His white blood cell count is up to 16.6 , but he is afebrile .
His sodium is down to 134 and I have adjusted his IV fluids accordingly .
He is making urine , but on the positive side I think he will diurese well enough on his own .
BUN and creatinine are 7 and 0.8 .
I am continuing Ativan for ETOH withdrawal .
He is reasonably comfortable at this point without significant tremor .
T = 35 minutes .
