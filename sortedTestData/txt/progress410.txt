I personally managed Mr. **NAME[AAA] in the ICU , a **AGE[in 60s]- year - old man with a history of stroke , brain edema , intracranial bleed , recent history of cardiac ischemia which is stable for the moment .
The patient is now on 3% sodium chloride .
His sodium has drifted up to 150 .
The edema in his brain clinically has improved somewhat .
He is more bright , follows simple commands , out of bed in a chair continuing to move along in his condition .
We are stopping the 3% sodium chloride today and we should anticipate that his brain swelling will remain stable .
It will be necessary to watch him closely however .
Otherwise his laboratory parameters are otherwise unremarkable .
He passes air reasonably well on both sides of his chest .
Heart is regular rhythm .
Abdomen is soft .
He puts out adequate amounts of urine .
We are continuing to watch him expectantly and supportively .
Critical care time 30 minutes .
