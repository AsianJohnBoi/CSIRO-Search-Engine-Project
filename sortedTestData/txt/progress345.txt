EVALUATION DATE :
**DATE[Apr 16 07]
Date of service is **DATE[Apr 16 2007] .
Currently continuing to see this **AGE[in 60s]- year - old patient initially status post bilateral double - lung reduction surgery .
Continue to follow for the current Critical Care issues .
1. Respiratory failure .
2. Hemodynamic instability .
3. Renal failure , with electrolyte abnormalities .
4. Fever with leukocytosis .
Concern about possible infectious etiology .
I examined her , reviewed her laboratory data , chart data , chest x-ray .
She hemodynamically still vasodilated .
Still requiring Levophed despite coming off dialysis yesterday .
With this in the setting of a low - grade temperature and leukocytosis , which is new , I am concerned at this point in time about an infectious etiology .
So at this point in time , she is currently on 0.05 of Levophed down from 0.1 .
We will try to wean her off if she tolerates .
She continues on prednisone which is maintenance for some adrenal insufficiency .
If she does not come off of Levophed , it may be reasonable to restress her to see whether or not this helps come off her Levophed requirements , but in the meantime , we will just continue to wean it down and see if she comes off of it .
From a respiratory standpoint , the patient is not weaning well today .
Immediate failure on trach mask after being off the vent for about 36 hours , she required to go back on the vent yesterday late afternoon early evening .
So I think at this point in time in light of everything that is going on we will just her on the vent and rest .
Her A-a gradient remains stable .
She is on 40% and 5 of PEEP .
From a renal electrolyte standpoint , she is in renal failure , no evidence of recovery at this point in time .
She was hypophosphatemic , which I did replace her phosphate .
In light that we are trying to get volume off as per the Primary Service despite even in the setting of going on high - dose vasopressors .
I think at this point in time kind of defeats the purpose .
Intravascularly , she is probably on the dry side , and the fact that she is still malnourished , it is going to be hard for her to still mobilize a lot of fluid .
So I think at this point in time , I did discuss with Renal who agreed to go ahead and put her back on CVVHDF and try to get volume off this way , and hopefully , it will be less hemodynamically compromising to her system .
So we will put her on Prisma , and we will start removing 50 an hour and if she tolerates it and is not requiring any further elevations of her vasoactive medications , we will continue to push her volume ________ as she tolerates .
Otherwise from an ID standpoint , the patient with a low - grade of 38 , leukocytosis , with a white count now up to 11.5 .
Concerned about infectious etiology in this setting .
She is on Cipro to complete a course for coverage for pseudomonas in her urine as well as E. coli , and klebsiella pneumonia .
I did continue her on the Cipro at this point in time .
I also added vancomycin for gram - positive coverage .
I did send off blood cultures and a BAL and will address antibiotics accordingly .
From a GI , nutritional standpoint , patient with increase in abdominal pain , little bit distension , generalized tenderness mostly in the epigastric region .
Unsure what to make of this in light that she has always had some vague abdominal complaints , abdominal pain .
I did send off LFT s and amylase and lipase , and I will get a CT scan of her abdomen just to rule out intra - abdominal pathology .
Also will go ahead and scan her chest while she is downstairs as well especially in light that she is not weaning well .
Otherwise , we will continue her current supportive care and management .
We will follow up on her CT scan , follow up on her cultures .
Otherwise , continue her current supportive care and management .
I did discuss with both Thoracic Service and the patient 's daughter __________ about the patient 's current clinical status and concerns .
Critical care time = 42 minutes .
