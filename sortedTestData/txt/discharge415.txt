HOSPITAL COURSE :
Mrs. **NAME[AAA] is an **AGE[in 80s]- year - old white female who was a resident of independent living at Longwood and was followed by Dr. **NAME[WWW] over there .
She was admitted through the ER on **DATE[Jan 16 2008] , with increasing shortness of breath with wheezing and left eye discomfort .
She had had a previous fall on **DATE[Jan 14 2008] , and had been evaluated in the ER at **INSTITUTION 's and noted to have right periorbital bruising and hematoma .
On admission to the hospital , the patient was noted to have significant hyponatremia of 118 and developed intermittent tachycardia overnight postadmission .
The patient 's ocular zoster was evaluated by the ophthalmologist , and she was started on topical as well as systemic antivirals , topical steroids , and Neurontin for postherpetic analgesia .
For her hyponatremia , her diuretics were held , as was her Celexa , and normal saline was started and there was some initial improvement of her labs .
However , the hyponatremia , which had initially started to show an improvement again acutely deteriorated to a value of 113 and nephrology opinion was obtained .
Urine electrolytes were ordered .
She was started on normal saline along with Lasix .
Her p.o. intake was not very good and there was an element of fluid restriction that was added to her hyponatremia management .
For her exacerbation of COPD , pulmonary opinion was obtained .
She was initially placed on steroids and antibiotics , nebulizer treatment , and oxygen support .
She was closely followed by the team , and her antibiotics were subsequently discontinued , and her steroids were placed on a taper .
Again , after showing an initial improvement in her respiratory status , the patient over the weekend deteriorated suddenly with development of acute respiratory acidosis .
The underlying etiology was thought to be her severe COPD .
She was also noted to show a dynamic airway collapse on the CAT scan .
No fixed structural narrowing was , however , noted .
An opinion from otolaryngology was also obtained .
Their opinion was that the patient 's respiratory decompensation may be related to the underlying tracheomalacia or to her underlying COPD .
The larynx was noted to be patent , and her upper airway was actually good .
With the continued deterioration of her respiratory status , she was placed on BiPAP support .
With the continued deterioration of her general condition , discussions were held with her power of attorney , Ms. **NAME[CCC] , and her advanced directives were re - reviewed .
It was felt that the patient would not have wanted aggressive interventions including intubation and mechanical ventilation .
Based on this , comfort care measures were ensued , and the BiPAP was removed .
The patient was placed on morphine .
She passed away peacefully on **DATE[Jan 22 2008] .
The patient had exhibited some cardiac dysrhythmia at the time of admission and for this , cardiology had been consulted .
