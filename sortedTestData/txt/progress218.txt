VENTILATOR MANAGEMENT NOTE
I am managing this **AGE[in 60s]- year - old female with respiratory and renal failure after external wound debridement and pectoralis flaps .
Mrs. **NAME[AAA] is awake and alert this morning .
Yesterday , she was able to go from 9 a.m. till 9 p.m. on 10 cm of water pressure support .
After that , I rested her on assist control .
Overnight , her peak airway pressures , minute ventilation , and gas exchange have been adequate .
She does not have a chest x-ray today .
I have her out of bed into a chair and I have placed her back on 10 cm of water pressure support with a plan to let her go for as long as tolerated today before resting her back on AC .
She is finishing up a course of cefepime and vancomycin for her __________ .
Clinically , she is improving .
Her white count is stable and she has been afebrile .
I have her on an ACE inhibitor and Coreg for her ischemic heart disease .
I have increased her tube feeds slightly .
She has stress ulcer and DVT prophylaxis .
Of note , she has a significantly elevated TSH level with a normal T4 which has been confirmed by a repeat thyroid function test .
I suspect that she is not absorbing her p.o. Synthroid well in the setting of her tube feeding .
I have asked for Endocrinology to see if they have any other further input as well .
