I personally managed Mr **NAME[AAA] in the ICU , a **AGE[in 60s]- year - old man with a history of stroke , lethargy , somnolence , brain edema and aspiration pneumonitis .
The patient is clearly deteriorating in his ventilation function this morning .
He has coarse rattly respirations .
His chest x-ray continues to show bilateral infiltrate , quite compatible with aspiration .
He does not appear to have an adequate reflux , so I think he is continuously aspirating .
At this point I think it will be necessary to protect his airway by reintubating him and also I think a tracheostomy is in his best interest as this will allow us to get good pulmonary toilet and also avoid further aspiration .
I have discussed this with the neurology team .
The patient was given adequate amounts of anesthesia and intubated by the critical care fellow under my direct supervision .
The intubation was successful without any complications .
There were good breath sounds on both sides .
C02 positive .
Vital signs and oxygen saturation remain stable .
The endotracheal tube is taped in place at 23 cm and chest x-ray was ordered .
There was a large amount of secretions suctioned out following intubation .
We will discuss with the family the potential for bedside percutaneous tracheostomy tomorrow , otherwise we have held off on his PEG for a fever and we will continue to culture him now and see if this presents any aspect of pneumonia .
Otherwise his overall condition remains about the same and he will be now for improved pulmonary toilet and bedside tracheostomy tomorrow .
Critical care time is minutes .
