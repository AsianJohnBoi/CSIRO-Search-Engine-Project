The patient admitted for elective intervention of the LAD .
He was found to have widely patent stents in the right coronary which were stented recently .
He had a 95% to 99% proximal and ostial diagonal lesion involving the takeoff .
This also was noted to originate in the area of diffuse 50% to 60% proximal and mid LAD disease .
Because of the bifurcation nature of the lesion , we had to stent the diagonal artery and the LAD , and kissing balloons were used .
A 2.5 x 28 Cypher stent and 2.5 x 13 Cypher stent were placed into the diagonal .
We also placed a 3.0 x 28 Cypher stent in the LAD .
There was no residual stenosis with excellent angiographic result .

FINAL DIAGNOSES :
1. Coronary artery disease .
2. Unstable angina .
3. Hyperlipidemia .
4. Diabetes .
