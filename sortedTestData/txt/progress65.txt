Chart , including 36 - hr rounding reprot , reviewed .
Patient was seen and examined , discussed with the FHC Residents .
History and physical exam were reviewed .
Concur with assessment and plan .
Notations below .
-- see H&amp;P and my admit note .
-- when pt was seen early this morning she was reluctant to speak with me and only consented to a physical exam , and did not answer other questions other than to say she did not feel like talking at the time .
-- she is know to me from prior admission to the FHC case .
her case is a prolonged , sad , and deteriorting one .
-- prolong hospitalization can exacerbate some of her Axis I and II conditions
-- we will stabilize her FEN , initiate c.dif abx , and when we can proceed safely and effecitvely with further mgt as outpt we will .
-- till then will con 't active inpt pmgt of her baseline outpt issue .
-- minimizing the number of active meds has been a goal in the past as i recall .
still would add Vit D 400 IU BID and Calcium 600 mg BID , as well as MVI with folate .
-- further address BP meds .
currently only on CCB .
re-assess BP after dialysis .
-- t/c d/c lipitor b/c of limited M&amp ; M effect in pts on dialysis .
