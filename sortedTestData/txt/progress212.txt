**DATE[Mar 25 07]
This is a ventilator management note .
I am managing this **AGE[in 60s]- year - old female with respiratory failure after sternal wound debridement due to mediastinitis as a complication of her coronary artery bypass grafting .
She now presents with respiratory and renal failure .
On my evaluation today , Ms. **NAME[AAA] is awake , alert , and oriented , and she has no complaints .
On chest x-ray , there is progressive decrease in her pulmonary vascular congestion .
Her both right and left - sided pigtails are in place , and she is still on assist control with peak airway pressures in the low 30s .
Yesterday , we tried a brief trial of pressure support ventilation which he failed with tachypnea and low tidal volumes .
Currently , her tidal volume is set at 500 ml with a PEEP of 10 .
I will plan to try another pressure support ventilation today in the face of recent ultrafiltration and decreased fluid overload .
In terms of her mediastinitis , she is on day 31 of her cefepime out of a six - week course .
She is also on vancomycin .
Her renal failure is steady with a BUN of 35 and creatinine of 1.8 .
She is on intermittent hemodialysis and she will get dialyzed again this coming Tuesday .
She is tolerating her tube feeds and she is on peptic ulcer and DVT prophylaxis .
