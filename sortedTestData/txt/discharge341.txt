CONSULTS :

2. Home care consult .
3. PT .
4. OT .
IMPORTANT RESULTS :
1. Chest x-ray portable on **DATE[Mar 13 2007] , showing cardiomegaly , pacer , and pathy airspace opacity at the right base mostly likely representing atelectasis although pneumonia or aspiration cannot be excluded .
2. **DATE[Mar 14 2007] , chest x-ray PA and lateral showing a probable interval increased airspace opacity in the right middle and lower zones which could represent pneumonia or edema .
3. Chest x-ray PA and lateral on **DATE[Mar 17 2007] , which showed cardiomegaly , small bilateral pleural effusion , and early left lobe infiltrate .
4. EKG on **DATE[Mar 14 2007] , showing atrial fibrillation with PVC s , right bundle-branch block , and left anterior hemiblock .
5. Echocardiogram on **DATE[Mar 19 2007] , showing normal right ventricular size and function .
LV ejection fraction estimated at 35 % to 40 % , nondilated left ventricle with moderately impaired systolic function and regional wall motion abnormalities consistent with coronary artery disease , moderately severe mitral regurgitation with enlargement of the left atrium , and aortic sclerosis with moderate aortic regurgitation .
6. B-type natriuretic peptide on **DATE[Mar 18 2007] , was 463 , on **DATE[Mar] was 294 .
**INSTITUTION COURSE :
Mr. **NAME[AAA] is an **AGE[in 80s]- year - old gentleman with a history significant for multiple TIA s; chronic atrial fibrillation , on Coumadin ; coronary artery disease ; and COPD who presented with increased wheezing and shortness of breath .
He had not had any fevers , however , had had a persistent cough .
On admission , he had a chest x-ray which showed a questionable right lower lobe pneumonia .
It actually had patchy airspace opacity where atelectasis , pneumonia , or aspiration could not be ruled out .
He had been started on ceftriaxone and azithromycin .
He developed fever after admission to 38.4 .
Urinalysis showed trace leukocyte esterase , 11 to 20 wbc 's , and 3 + bacteria .
His urine culture eventually grew out enterococcus , so his ceftriaxone was discontinued , and he was started on Unasyn .
Legionella urinary antigen was negative .
Blood cultures were also negative .
Subsequent chest x-rays on day 2 and day 5 of admission showed increasing cephalization , what looked like early congestive heart failure .
Her B-type natriuretic peptide **DATE[Mar 18 2007] , was 463 .
A repeat on **DATE[Mar 19 2007] , was 294 .
He was started on 40 mg of IV Lasix once daily , that was switched to oral 40 mg prior to discharge .
He was seen by Dr. **NAME[VVV] who changed his metoprolol to Coreg and recommended an ACE inhibitor .
He had an echocardiogram which showed an LV ejection fraction of 35 % to 40 % with moderately severe mitral regurgitation , aortic sclerosis with moderate aortic regurgitation .
However , he had a nondilated left ventricle with moderately impaired systolic function and regional wall motion abnormalities .
His EKG on admission showed atrial fibrillation with PVC s and aberrantly conductive complexes that was unchanged from prior .
His troponin was also negative on admission .
Prior to discharge , the patient improved symptomatically , however , continued to have diffuse wheezes and some rhonchi with occasional wheezes .
He will be discharged to home on round - the - clock DuoNeb treatment .
He also had an oxygen requirement during the hospitalization initially on 4 L of oxygen .
He was able to be weaned down to 3 L .
His resting pulse oximeter was 2 to 3 L while at exercise required up to 4 L of oxygen .
Home nursing was consulted , and he will be getting home oxygen as well as PT and OT at home .
During hospitalization , Mr. **NAME[AAA] developed a supratherapeutic INR up to 4.8 .
On admission , he was 1.6 .
At home , he had been getting 7.5 mg of Coumadin , had been loaded with 10 mg on admission .
However , his INR became supratherapeutic .
It was held for 2 days , and on discharge , his INR was 2.0 .
He was discharged home on 2 mg of Coumadin .
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS :
1. Tylenol 650 mg p.o. q.6 h. p.r.n.
2. DuoNebs q.4 h. around the clock while awake .
3. Norvasc 10 mg p.o. q. day .
4. Augmentin 500 mg p.o. q.12 h. for an additional 3 days until **DATE[Mar 23 2007] , for a total of 10 - day course .
