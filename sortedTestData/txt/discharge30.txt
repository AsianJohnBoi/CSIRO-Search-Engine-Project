DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES :
1. Metastatic ocular melanoma .
2. Acute renal failure with hyperkalemia .
3. Disseminated intravascular coagulation .
**INSTITUTION COURSE :
Mrs. **NAME[AAA] is a **AGE[in 70s]- year-old female with a history of metastatic ocular melanoma , status post enucleation of the right eye performed in 1994 .
The patient has undergone multiple different chemotherapeutic regimens , as well as Interferon and Interleukin-2 in the past , and was most recently enrolled in a new UPCI protocol .
The patient has known worsening metastatic disease in the lung , liver , soft tissues as well as spine , and is also known to have significant compression of the common bile duct .
The patient did have to discontinue her most recent UPCI experimental protocol secondary to worsening liver function tests as well as diarrhea .
The patient presented today to **NAME[VVV] for routine follow up , and at that time had some basic labs drawn which revealed a creatinine of 1.8 and a potassium level of 6.4 .
The patient was subsequently admitted for management of her hyperkalemia .
1. With regards to the patient 's metabolic abnormalities including her elevated creatinine and hyperkalemia , the patient did receive multiple doses of Kayexalate , and did also receive 1 gram of calcium gluconate as well .
The patient did not have any EKG changes consistent with hyperkalemia .
We did hydrate the patient with IV fluids , and we did discontinue the potassium supplements that the patient had been receiving as an outpatient .
With these therapies , we did discontinue her potassium level down to within the normal range by the time of discharge .
2. With regards to the patient 's thrombocytopenia , we did check a DIC panel which was positive , demonstrating a low fibrinogen , positive D-dimer , and positive fibrin degradation products .
The patient , in addition , also had a mildly elevated INR of 1.5 .
We did give the patient some FFP , but given her very poor prognosis at this point , we did not further aggressively manage the DIC .
3. With regards to the patient 's metastatic ocular melanoma , we did discuss the patient 's perception of her current treatment options .
She did express understanding of the fact that there was not much more to be done in terms of treatment for her disease , and she did express a desire in terms of talking with the palliative care service here .
We subsequently did consult the palliative care service to discuss options of palliative care versus home hospice with the patient .
After discussing these issues with the patient , she did decide to become comfort measures only and to be discharged to home with home hospice .

1. Phos-Lo 1334 mg p.o. t.i.d. with meals .
2. Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.
