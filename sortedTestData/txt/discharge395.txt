**DATE[Sep 07 2007]
DISCHARGE DATE :
**DATE[Sep 09 2007]
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES :
1. Chest pain of unclear etiology .
2. End - stage renal disease .
CONSULTS :
Nephrology .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a **AGE[in 40s]- year - old African American male who presented to the ED on **DATE[Sep 7 2007] , complaining of chest pain , which began during his hemodialysis treatment on **DATE[Sep 6 2007] .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
1. Diabetes .
2. Hypertension .
3. End - stage renal disease on hemodialysis Tuesday , Thursday , and Saturday .
4. Hepatitis C .
5. DVT .
6. PE .
7. Status post filter placement in **DATE[Nov 2005] .
8. GI bleed .
9. Coronary artery disease , status post MI and stent in 2005 .
He states that while he was in dialysis a few days ago , he woke up and was feeling chest pain as well as pain all over his body .
He felt that he was being " over dialyzed ."
He asked the staff of hemodialysis clinic to end the treatment , but the patient states that they would only let him leave if he signed out AMA .
Since that time , he has been having this continued chest pain and presented to the ED .
LABORATORY , RADIOGRAPHIC , AND OTHER DIAGNOSTIC STUDY FINDINGS :
Sodium 130 , potassium 4.8 , chloride 75 , CO2 is 27 , BUN 34 , creatinine 11.8 , glucose 85 , calcium 9.0 , magnesium 1.2 , phosphate 6.2 .
He had 3 negative troponins .
White count 10.6 , hemoglobin 12.2 , hematocrit 36.2 , and platelet count 448 .
INR 1.2 .
Chest x-ray showed unremarkable portable chest .
With his history of heart disease , we did admit him for rule out .
Again , he had 3 negative cardiac enzymes .
Since he is at high risk for further coronary events , we told him we would like to do another stress test .
He does have an adenosine stress test on record from **DATE[Nov 2006] that showed no significant EKG abnormalities with an apparent mild partially reversible effusion defect in the inferior wall at the base extending toward the mid LV .
However , the apparent defect did completely correct with attenuation correction .
The wall motion in the inferior wall was preserved .
At that time , they could not completely exclude the presence of mild ischemia in the distal RCA or distal circumflex vessels in a patient with known underlying circumflex and RCA distribution with prior stents .
However , the defects were felt to most likely represent diaphragmatic attenuation .
Therefore at that time , gated wall perfusion study was within normal limits .
The EF was about 43% .
We offered to do another stress test ; however , the patient refusing , he did not want another stress test .
Furthermore , a clinical suspicion is that this pain that he is exhibiting is not coronary in nature .
His pain is somewhat generalized throughout his entire body .
Fortunately after 1 day of hospitalization , his pain is a bit improved .
We recommend that he be discharged home and take Tylenol as needed .
He was seen by the Renal Service and will be dialyzed today prior to his discharge .

If his dialysis is uneventful , he will be discharged to home .
