**DATE[Apr 30 07]
I am seeing Mrs. **NAME[AAA] for critical care at the request of Dr. **NAME[YYY ZZZ] .
I have examined the patient , reviewed her medication record and her labs , and made adjustments to her therapy .
Mrs. **NAME[AAA] is a **AGE[in 60s]- year - old woman who had bilateral lung reduction surgery .
Her course has been complicated by acute renal failure requiring continuous hemodialysis as well as respiratory failure .
The patient has made some progress since the last time I saw her .
Her fluid overload is diminished and she is having a mildly negative fluid balance daily with the hemodialysis which I will continue .
Neurologically she appears to be alert and does not require adjustments to her medication on that account .
Her lungs are clear and equal with soft breath sounds .
Her respiratory rate is 21 and she is well saturated on 40% aerosol trach mask .
The patient 's white blood cell count has fallen dramatically over the past three to four days .
I noticed the absolute neutrophil count is 0.02 and so I have placed the patient on neutropenia precautions .
I have added Neupogen to her regimen to try to help her recover from this as rapidly as possible .
I have asked the Pharmacist to review her medications to see if any of them may be responsible for neutropenia .
The only one that was identified is the lansoprazole which I have discontinued and have started Pepcid instead since that does not appear to cause neutropenia .
There is another possibility that this could be due to infection .
The patient is afebrile and does not appear to be septic , however I drew blood cultures never - the - less looking for that as a possible source of fall in her white blood cell count .
The glucoses have been ranging between 79 and 206 due to cycled tube feeding .
I am making no adjustments to her therapy .
CRITICAL CARE TIME :
The total time taken in the care of this critically - ill patient is **AGE[in 30s] minutes .
