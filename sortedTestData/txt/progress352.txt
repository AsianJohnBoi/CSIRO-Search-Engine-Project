I am seeing this critically ill woman for management of respiratory insufficiency and volume overload , nutritional support , glycemic control .
I have examined the patient , laboratory data , chest x-ray film , events of the evening .
From a respiratory standpoint , she was off of mechanical ventilatory support last night .
Her A-a gradient is reasonable at 40% .
She is breathing about 13 which is a substantial improvement .
Because of her hemodynamic lability , we have not converted her over to intermittent dialysis , but will continue with ultrafiltration with CVVH , currently at 150 cubic centimeters an hour .
She was , overall , negative 200 cubic centimeters yesterday , and 600 so far this morning .
I continue her on enteral nutritional support with TwoCal tube feeds at 30 an hour , which she is tolerating well .
Belly exam is benign .
She will get a diffuse rash over her lower extremities .
She is off Cipro , off of the Zoloft .
No other clear etiology .
I suspect it will resolve over time .
Continue on long and short - acting insulin for glycemic control .
Blood sugar is running between 96 and 140 .
Continue DVT prophylaxis , GI prophylaxis , and she is still on a low dose of prednisone .
Off of antibiotics except for Flagyl currently .
No evidence of active infection .
White count is 5.2 .
Hematocrit is 28 .
Continue supportive care of this critically ill woman with a prolonged ventilatory support , still unable to switch over to intermittent hemodialysis due to hypotension , off of Levophed currently .
T = 30 .
