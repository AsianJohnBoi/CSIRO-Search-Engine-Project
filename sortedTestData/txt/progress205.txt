I am managing this critically - ill **AGE[in 60s]- year - old female who is status post sternal debridement .
Hospital course has been complicated by respiratory failure and fluid overload .
I am seeing her for management of these issues .
I have seen and examined the patient and reviewed her laboratory , radiographic , and Emtek data and discussed the management with the plastic surgeons .
Problems and management are as follows :
1. RESPIRATORY FAILURE :
Chest x-ray shows a significant decrease in the bilateral effusions after placement of her pigtail catheter .
On the vent , I have left her on assist control overnight .
Her peak airway pressures , minute ventilation , and gas exchange have been adequate .
In light of her improving radiographic appearance , I have placed her on a pressure support trial .
After a couple of hours on pressure support , her spontaneous tidal volumes are adequate and I have switched her to trach mask trial .
She has done well for about three to four hours on trach mask trial but this afternoon became somewhat fatigued and I have rested her back on assist control .
2. CHRONIC RENAL INSUFFICIENCY :
BUN and creatinine remain elevated at 87 and 3.2 .
Overall , I think she is somewhat dry today and I have left her on some gentle hydration and have discontinued her Lasix .
3. MEDIASTINITIS :
White blood cell count is down to 15,000 today .
She has been afebrile .
She is continuing through a six week course of cefepime .
I have redosed her vancomycin today with thought to recheck her again in 48 hours .
4. ICU PROPHYLAXIS :
I started her back on some Lopressor for heart rate and blood pressure control in light of her ischemic heart disease .
Her tube feeds are at goal rate and strength .
She has stress ulcer and DVT prophylaxis .
I have her on an insulin drip for tight glycemic control .
Total critical care time = 40 minutes .
