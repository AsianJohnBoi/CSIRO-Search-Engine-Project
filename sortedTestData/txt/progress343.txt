PROCEDURE :
Tracheostomy tube change .
DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE :
I was called to evaluate Mrs. **NAME[AAA] .
Following unsuccessful tracheostomy tube change attempted , she had a previous Portex tracheostomy tube in place and was being changed to a #6 Shiley from a #7 Portex .
I attempted to gently insert the #6 Shiley ; however , her percutaneous tracheostomy site was mildly contracted and I was unable to pass this without resistance .
I then supervised my fellow , placing a #4 Shiley trach with inner cannula , it passed with ease .
Endotracheal positioning was immediately confirmed with fiberoptic bronchoscopy .
The patient tolerated the procedure well , bagged easily , and maintain acceptable oxygen saturations with bag mask support during the entire procedure .
I was present and supervised all aspects of this procedure .
