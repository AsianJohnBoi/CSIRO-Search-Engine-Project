ASSESSMENT AND PLAN :
1. Pulmonary .
Respiratory failure .
I am currently managing Mrs. **NAME[AAA] on assist - control ventilation rate of 14 , tidal volume 400 , 70% FiO2 and 5 of
PEEP .
Chest x-ray continues to show pulmonary edema and appears slightly worse over the course of the last 24 hours .
I will continue to wean her FiO2 as tolerated to maintain and oxygen saturation of greater than 92% and suspect she will not be able to tolerate weaning trials until her fluid balance is overall net negative .

Extremities are warm and adequately perfused .
She is in sinus rhythm in the 90s with mean pressures in the 60s to 70s .

Afebrile with a white count of 5.0 .
There has been some erythema to the left lower extremity site of previous arterial line .
I have discontinued the A-line and obtain blood cultures today .

Sodium 134 , potassium 4.0 and magnesium 2.3 .
Replace electrolytes per protocol , and I started PhosLo .

Net positive in her overall fluid balance .

8. Endocrine .
Hyperglycemia .
