She had recurrent chest pain and had a relook on **DATE[May 13 2007] .
The stents were patent and the distal left circumflex with a 90% stenosis after the takeoff of the large OM2 , was recommended medical treatment because if there was a PCI to the distal left circumflex , it would potentially compromise the OM2 which was a large vessel .
