ATTENDING PHYSICIAN :
**NAME[YYY M. ZZZ] , M.D.
ADMISSION DATE :
**DATE[Feb 12 2007]
EVALUATION DATE :
**DATE[Mar 21 07]
Date of service **DATE[Mar 21 2007] .
I saw the patient on rounds with the ICU team .
I interviewed and examined the patient at the bedside .
I reviewed her data on Emtek , including vital signs , I 's and O 's , laboratory data , and medication list .
I reviewed the House Staff note .
I discussed the management plan with the Critical Care team .
The patient is a **AGE[in 60s]- year - old female admitted on **DATE[Feb 12 2007] with sternitis , status post debridement .
She had an infected sternal wound following a CABG times four at another hospital that was done about six months ago .
She has had ongoing respiratory failure , renal failure requiring hemodialysis , bilateral pleural effusions , status post drainage on the left side by Interventional Radiology and on the right side by the Critical Care team .
She has also a history of diabetes .
She complains of " sour mouth ," and according to the Nursing staff , has persistently been nauseated .
T-max is 37.4 , heart rate is in the 60s , mean arterial pressure 86 to 100 .
She is on 40% FiO2 , PEEP of 8 on assist control ventilation .
Her urine output 575 ml for 24 hours .
Total I 's and O 's are 2.5 in and 3.2 out , of which ultrafiltration was 2 .
__________ liters .
JP drainage 110 and 20 ml , respectively , serosanguineous is quite clear .
Her right - sided chest tube 200 ml .
She has had small , formed stool .
Her blood sugars 62 to 127 .
Her tube feeds currently off , on hold .
Sodium is 134 , potassium 3.6 , BUN and creatinine are 69 and 2.3 , respectively .
Hemoglobin is 8.7 , unchanged .
White blood count 10.2 .
Albumin is 1.8 .
Chest x-ray shows left - sided pleural effusion .
A CT scan of the chest , abdomen , and pelvis shows left - sided effusion that is partly loculated , some possible sludge in the gallbladder , anasarca , what appears to be a seroma of the right anterior chest wall , and a small amount of loculated fluid around her drain site over the left chest wall .
Of note , on her physical examination , there is no evidence of cellulitis of her chest wall .
She does have some left abdominal wall tenderness .
She is answering questions appropriately .
She is on subcu heparin , Pepcid .
Her insulin infusion is currently off .
She is on cefepime day 27 , Synthroid , and vancomycin that is being dosed as needed .
Because of the patient 's heart rate in the 50s , she is not on any Lopressor .
We will continue to watch that .
I am obtaining a right upper quadrant ultrasound to evaluate her gallbladder because of her persistent nausea .
I am going to change her Pepcid to Protonix in case this is a gastritis .
We are also going to give the patient an enema to give her a better bowel movement .
She is scheduled for hemodialysis today .
We will follow her left effusion .
If she continues to have persistent , left - sided effusion , in particular because it is partly loculated , she will likely require ultrasound or CT - guided catheter drainage .
We will try to resume her tube feeds at a low rate .
She is on vancomycin and cefepime for her sternitis , which we will continue .
We will also continue her subcu heparin for DVT prophylaxis .
Critical care time is 31 minutes .
