EKG notable to be in her known atrial fibrillation .
Chest x-ray on admission had some mild interstitial edema and she was treated with Lasix with which she diuresed well and is now clinically hemodynamically stable .
Her mental status has improved and was likely caused by her hypoglycemia , therefore , we will hold her Glipizide .
She will continue with her Synthroid medication and cardiovascularly and hemodynamically she is stable .
