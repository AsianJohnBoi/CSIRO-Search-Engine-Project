I personally interviewed and examined the patient today .
The patient was complaining of severe pain in the back initially when his PCA pump was continued .
However , once he took his oral morphine sulfate , he improved and was having a lot less pain .
He continues to have some sensory symptoms down his left leg .
He continues to have marked pain .
He denies any nausea , vomiting , diarrhea , or constipation .
He has not had any fever or chills .
I reviewed his CT scan with Radiology .
He has compression fracture and recommendation of Radiology is to treat him medically first before considering vertebroplasty .

His vital signs are stable and normal .

Chest :
Clear .
Heart :
Regular rhythm .
No murmurs .

PROBLEMS :
1. Severe low back pain at this time .
We plan to continue him on morphine sulfate around the clock to see if we can control his pain better .
He will remain on his fentanyl patch as well .
2. Abdominal pain .
This is much better at this time .
No specific change in the medications will be made .
