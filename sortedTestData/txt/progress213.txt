VENTILATOR MANAGEMENT NOTE
I am managing this **AGE[in 60s]- year - old female with respiratory failure after a sternal wound debridement from mediastinitis complicated by respiratory and renal failure .
Ms. **NAME[AAA] is awake , alert , and oriented , and she is without complaints this morning .
Chest x-ray shows a decrease in her pulmonary vascular congestion .
Her right - sided and left - sided pigtails were in place overnight .
She has been on assist / control with peak airway pressures in the low 30s on a tidal volume of 500 .
Her PEEP is at 10 .
Plan today is to discontinue her right pigtail .
It has been in over 5 days , and although it is still continuing to drain some , I think the risk of infection is beginning to outweigh the persistent drainage of the pleural effusion .
I have placed her on a pressure support trial today with the plan to let her go for as long as tolerated , although I suspect that she will need to rest on full support this afternoon .
In terms of her mediastinitis , she is on day #32 of her cefepime out of a 6 - week course .
I have ordered a vancomycin trough prior to her next dose .
Her renal failure is stable .
She is on intermittent hemodialysis and she should be getting a tunneled dialysis catheter today .
She is tolerating her tube feeds adequately and I have switched her insulin drip to subcutaneous today .
