PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSES :
POST LAMINECTOMY SYNDROME , STATUS POST FAILED TRIAL OF INTRATHECAL OPIOID PUMP .
REASON FOR ADMISSION :
This is a AGE[in 40s]- year-old female with signs and symptoms of post laminectomy syndrome .
It was felt that a trial of an implanted intrathecal opioid pump might be of benefit to the patient .
She entered the hospital and began a trial of a morphine pump on DATE[Aug 29 07] .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient remained alert and oriented , afebrile with stable vitals during her stay .
However , she experienced significant nausea and vomiting with very little relief in her pre-existing pain during the morphine trial .
As a result , the intrathecal medication was changed from morphine to Dilaudid .
By postop day number 2 , her nausea had cleared and she was tolerating p.o. intake .
However , despite large increases in the intrathecal administration rate , she received essentially no relief of her pretrial pain .
She also complained of a severe positional headache on postop day number 1 .
This was treated with IV fluids and flat bed rest , and it resolved on its own prior to discharge .
The patient 's insertion site was clean , dry and intact .
Her motor exam and sensation to light touch appear to remain intact throughout her stay .
The patient noted that she had been prescribed fentanyl patches in the past .
However , she had syncopal episodes and apparent convulsions while using these .
As a result , this medication could not be considered as an option when the patient was not receiving adequate relief from the Dilaudid trial .
Finally , on postop day number 3 , secondary to failure of pain relief using either morphine or Dilaudid , and because of an inability to use fentanyl secondary to prior historical problems with that medication , it was elected to end the trial .
The catheter was pulled without complications , and the catheter insertion site was closed with a single pursestring stitch .
The patient was medically safe for discharge home on postop day number 3 .
