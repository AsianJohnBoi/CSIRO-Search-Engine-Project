EVALUATION DATE :
**DATE[Mar 28 07]
I was asked to see this **AGE[in 70s]- year - old gentleman transferred from 7D to the CTICU for further management secondary to hypoxic respiratory insufficiency .
I examined him and reviewed his laboratory data , chart data , and chest x-ray .
The patient is a **AGE[in 70s]- year - old gentleman with a history of cardiomyopathy and alcohol abuse who presents to an outside hospital with right - sided empyema .
He was transferred here on **DATE[Mar 26 2007] and underwent drainage on **DATE[Mar 27 2007] .
Culture at the outside hospital grew Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus and had been treated with vancomycin .
He was taken to the OR on **DATE[Mar 27 2007] and underwent chest tube placement on the right side and bronchoscopy .
Over the course of the last 24 hours , his A-a gradient had increasing work of breathing now on 2 liter Oxymizer with known metabolic and lactic acidosis .
Though hemodynamically , blood pressure was fine .
On examination , clinically , he did feel cool peripherally .
Otherwise looked ill upon initial evaluation .
Laboratory data revealed a metabolic and lactic acidosis and increased A-a gradient .
My concern at that point in time was probable sepsis .
In light of this , he was cultured .
Blood pressure actually was reasonable .
It did subsequently become better controlled on his own .
Initial blood pressure is 102 and mean is now down to the 70s .
I gently hydrated the patient , as well , and started him on empiric antibiotics after culturing him with vancomycin and cefepime .
I wanted to insure he had adequate coverage with MRSA and Enterococcus at this point in time .
His culture from the OR chest tube drainage from the right pleural space was negative .
So , the course of the night , his metabolic and lactic acidosis did resolve .
Clinically , he looked much better , making good urine throughout the course of the night .
In light of this , I thought that his perfusion was actually adequate .
I think it is probably reasonable to go ahead and get an echocardiogram just to get a baseline evaluation of his heart function , especially in light that he has a history of cardiomyopathy .
Otherwise , will follow cultures and continue his antibiotics .
Continue his current supportive care and management .
CRITICAL CARE TIME EQUALS 32 MINUTES .
THIS IS EXCLUDING ALL PROCEDURES .
