The patient 's family members had all been sick with this 2 to 3 days prior to his admission .
He noted in that morning of admission that he had numerous amounts of diarrhea , and he was unable to keep anything down ; therefore , he came to the Emergency Room and eventually got admitted for dehydration , likely a viral gastroenteritis .

Viral gastroenteritis .
The patient was aggressively hydrated and received almost 4 L of normal saline throughout his stay .
His multiple bowel movements have decreased .
His nausea and vomiting has gone away as well as his abdominal pain .
He is feeling much better this morning and is wishing to go home .
We did place him on p.r.n. Toradol and Tylenol , which subsequently helped his pain .
The patient is a Neurosurgery resident and has agreed that he will come back to the Emergency Room and / or call a PCP if he has increased nausea / vomiting , is unable to keep p.o. , or his abdominal pain worsens ; therefore , we will discharge him today with the above - noted medications .
He does not currently have a PCP , as his PCP has left , and he wishes to follow in the Montefiore 9th **INSTITUTION , although , he stated that he would like to make his own appointment , and therefore , I will give him the phone number **PHONE , and he can call them as needed for follow - up .
