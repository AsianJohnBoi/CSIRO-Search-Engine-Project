EVALUATION DATE :
**DATE[Feb 16 07]
I was asked by Dr. **NAME[YYY ZZZ] to see this **AGE[in 70s]- year - old gentleman who underwent single vessel CABG and redo sternotomy .
He had a previous CABG in the past .
Had his right side bypassed and as well has had a mitral valve band secondary to severe MR .
Reportedly his EF going in was about 20 to 25% .
He had severe pulmonary hypertension which was better after repair of his mitral valve .
I have been asked by Dr. **NAME[ZZZ] to manage him from a hemodynamic cardiovascular standpoint as well as from a respiratory standpoint .
I did examine him .
I reviewed his laboratory data , chart data , and chest x-ray .
Hemodynamically , he initially came out of the OR on just a small amount of Levophed at 0.02 mcg / kg / minute as well as epi at 0.15 mcg / kg / minute .
He was actually a little bit hypertensive and was able to come off of the Levophed without any problems .
His initial cardiac index when he came out was 1.8 .
He is preoperative index was also 1.8 .
Apparently after his chest was closed in the OR his index was two liters per minute .
At that point in time , CVP was down to around 10 to 12 .
I did initially give him some volume some Hextend .
Index is now down to 1.7 .
________ coming off pump which he seemed to tolerate fairly well .
In light of this , I did start him on milrinone initially at 0.25 titrating up to 0.4 .
At this point in time his index is now up to 2.5 .
________ has gotten better .
His lactate is coming down , now down from 1.8 to 1.3 .
He is clinically warm and well - perfused and he is making good urine throughout his postoperative course .
So at this point in time he is on 0.4 of milrinone .
He is on 0.15 mcg of epinephrine .
He did come out A paced and continues to be A paced with a rate of 100 .
Neurologically , he did wake up .
He did give bilateral hand grasp and wiggled his toes .
I did put him on a little bit of light sedation with propofol in light that I did want to keep him down overnight .
He seems to be tolerating this fairly well from a hemodynamic standpoint .
His mean arterial blood pressures are running in the mid to high 60 mmHg range .
So at this point in time we will continue his current inotropic support .
From a respiratory standpoint , he has improved with improvement in his A-a gradient .
Initially , his ABG came out with an increased A-a gradient .
He was recruited and at this point in time we are weaning down to 40% .
Sats right now remain 99 to 100% .
He is on an insulin drip on the 80 to 110 protocol .
Currently on three units an hour of insulin with blood sugar of 108 .
He has had no significant bleeding postoperatively .
At this point in time we will continue his current inotropic support .
He did get a total of 1.5 liters of Hextend for some hypotension with low filling pressures .
We will keep him mildly sedated overnight .
Critical care time = 45 minutes .
