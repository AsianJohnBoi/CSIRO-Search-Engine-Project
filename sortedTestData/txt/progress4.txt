I am managing this critically ill , **AGE[in 40s]- year - old male , status post repair of an SMA aneurysm , hospital course complicated by respiratory failure .
I have seen and examined the patient , reviewed his laboratory , radiographic , and Emtek data , and discussed the management with the vascular surgeons and general surgeons .
Problems and management are as follows :
1. Status post repair of SMA aneurysm .
He remains on prophylactic antibiotics with Cipro , Flagyl , and vancomycin .
On examination today , his abdomen this morning was significantly more distended than it had been previously .
He has tenderness in the bilateral lower quadrants , but no peritoneal signs .
His lactate is less than 1. I have ordered q.6 hourly lactate and arterial blood gas checks today in light of his increasing abdominal pain .
The differential diagnosis includes mesenteric ischemia , a mesenteric venous thrombosis , or possible reperfusion syndrome .
Over the course of the day , we have also been measuring his intra - abdominal pressures on a q.2 hourly basis .
Those started out higher today at 20 .
This afternoon , his abdomen feels somewhat less distended than it did this morning and his abdominal pressures are down to 13 .
We will continue to follow his lactates and arterial blood gases for the next 24 hours .
I have left him n.p.o. in light of his abdominal distention .
2. Respiratory failure .
Chest x-ray shows the duo-tube coiled in his posterior pharynx .
ET tube is in place , and he has left basilar atelectasis .
On the vent , I have left him on assist control .
His peak airway pressures have been adequate .
He has a mild respiratory acidosis in addition to his metabolic acidosis , and I think this is due to fentanyl as he does not overbreathe the vent .
I have decreased his minute ventilation slightly in order to start getting him to breathe over the vent but have not done any other vent weaning .
3. ICU prophylaxis .
I am cutting back his IV fluids today .
His urine output has been adequate .
He feels warm , dry , and well-perfused .
He remains n.p.o. at this point .
He has stress ulcer and DVT prophylaxis with a proton pump inhibitor and subcutaneous heparin .
Total critical care time equals 40 minutes .
