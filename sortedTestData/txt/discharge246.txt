HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
A **AGE[in 70s]- year - old female involved in a motor vehicle crash .
There was air bag deployment .
She reported that she was at an outside hospital briefly before she was transferred to the **INSTITUTION here for evaluation .
On arrival , she was awake and alert , but she was hard of hearing , she had nasofacial pain and she needed supplemental oxygen .
She had chest wall pain in the sternum , but she denied any abdominal pain or shortness of breath .
Her review of systems is otherwise negative as mentioned above .
The patient should be noted to have been trached at the time secondary to laryngeal cancer .
The patient was scanned in the emergency department and worked up , but the trauma evaluation eventually transferred to the floor in stable condition .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
On evaluation in the course of the patient on the floor on **DATE[Mar 8 2007] , the patient did well on the floor , had no complaints , was eating and had the head of her bed up 30 degrees as per Ophthalmology precautions because of her coming in with hyphema as well as a left lens dislocation .
However , at approximately 1530 , the patient had an episode of shortness of breath .
The patient 's nurse called Respiratory .
She had suction , had some sputum ; however , she did not improve .
The patient on exam was wheezy and I ordered DuoNeb .
Upon review of her laboratory , her troponins appeared to be mildly elevated .
Stat EKG and a chest x-ray as well as aspirin was given .
Cardiology was consulted and a beta - blocker was also given .
Looking at an old EKG compared to the EKG done that day , it appeared that there were some changes even compared to the old EKG with increase in the deflections of the ST wave inversions in some of the anterior leads .
Cardiology after reevaluating her suggested that she should get cardiac catheterization .
Later the next day , Cardiology requested that Ophthalmology okay the use of anticoagulant so that the patient may have cardiac catheterization .
After Ophthalmology did so , the patient was put on the board in order to have cardiac catheterization the next day .
On the day of **DATE[Mar 10 2007] , the patient had cardiac catheterization and was being prepped for .
The patient 's catheters were read on **DATE[Mar 11 2007] , and showed multivessel disease .
After evaluating it , Cardiology stated that the patient probably needs a CABG , at which point Cardiac Surgery was consulted .
Cardiac Surgery saw the patient during the day of **DATE[Mar 12 2007] , and stated that they could reevaluate her and have her visit with an outpatient .
At this point in time , it should be noticed that the patient is stating she does not want to have any cardiac or open heart surgery done at this period of time .
However , it is questionable whether or not Ophthalmology would be willing to do a surgical procedure with anesthesia until her heart has been cleared by Cardiology and Cardiac Surgery .
We will be giving the patient followup numbers and the Cardiac Surgery people stated that they will be calling the patient early next week to make sure she is not lost to followup .
At this point in time from the trauma standpoint , the patient surgically is stable and is ready to discharge home .
Ophthalmology states that they can follow up with her eye problems also outpatient .
Cardiology states that only the changes in medication in which she should have some aspirin , Zocor , as well as use of beta - blockers at home as part of her home medications are the only thing that they need to do at this point .
She should follow up outpatient also .
Cardiac Surgery will also follow with her outpatient .
At this point in time , we will discharge the patient home in stable condition .
DISCHARGE CONDITION :
Stable .
MEDICATIONS :
We will be resuming her home medications .
1. Singulair 10 mg at bedtime .
2. Zetia 10 mg by mouth at bedtime .

3. Bend at the knees and not at the waist .
4. Elevate the head at 30 degrees .
