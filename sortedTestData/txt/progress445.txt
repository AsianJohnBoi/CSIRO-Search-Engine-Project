The patient was examined on rounds with housestaff .
I have reviewed the patient data and films .
Last 24 hrs : required reintubation
Impression :
**AGE[in 40s] year old male with severe emphysema and acute respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation .
1. Resp failure : receiving mechanical ventilation : tolerating PS ventilation
PS = 5 -- will keep intubated today to rest respiratory muscles .
2. COPD exacerbation -- on solumedrol , azithromycin , xopenex
3. narcotic dependence -- on methadone
4. anxiety -- restarted xanax .
-- he is requiring hi dose propofol -- it would appear that his anxiety may be the precipitant of this exacerbation -- when extubated , we will have our psychiatrists or palliative care medicine to evaluate him for this interesting interaction of his anxiety and his severe lung disease
Critical care time spent exclusive of teaching and procedures = 40 Minutes , provided throughout the day .
