HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a **AGE[in 20s] year old right handed white female with history of polysubstance drug abuse who was found unresponsive after last having been seen 18 hours earlier .
She was admitted to **INSTITUTION in **PLACE , PA with severe rhabdomyolysis which led to acute tubular necrosis and renal failure which itself required several dialysis sessions .
Her renal failure began to improve and her last dialysis session occurred six days prior to her admission to **INSTITUTION .
In the hospital she was found to have right sided weakness and bilateral lower extremity weakness of uncertain etiology .
The patient was transferred to **INSTITUTION Harmarville on **DATE[Apr 16 2007] with BUN and creatinine the following day of 35 and 5.6 .
She was maintained on Bumex , but developed shortness of breath and was transferred to **STREET-ADDRESS **INSTITUTION early on the morning of **DATE[Apr 19 2007] .
In the Emergency Department she was given Lasix with success and diuresed a good amount of fluid .
Potassium at the time of admission was low and she required vigorous potassium replacement .
She was therefore admitted to the hospital for acute care .
Initially she was admitted to 3-B , but had to be transferred to the stepdown unit because her pulmonary status showed substantial deterioration .
She was breathing rapidly and working to breath .
In addition she showed evidence for anasarca .
Although she had a good response to diuretic therapy it was felt that she would require one more dialysis session to try to pull off fluid from the lungs and allow her to breath more comfortably .
This was accomplished on the first hospital day .
The patient began to feel more comfortable by the second day .
Her BNP was elevated at 920 .
Creatinine showed substantial improvement all the way through her hospitalization and at the time of discharge her BUN and creatinine had practically normalized with a BUN of 25 and a creatinine of 1.3 .
During this hospitalization she was seen in consultation by Cardiology who did not feel that the patient had intrinsic heart disease despite the elevated BNP .
The patient underwent an echocardiogram which showed normal left ventricular size and function with an LVEF of 25% .
There was slightly thickened mitral valve leaflets and mild regurgitation , a normal aortic valve , normal right ventricular size and function and no pericardial effusion .
Venous Doppler studies were negative for any evidence to suggest deep vein thrombosis of the lower extremities .
During hospitalization the patient showed evidence of labile hypertension .
This was especially associated with anxiety in anticipation of procedures .
On the last hospital day the patient underwent successful left lumbar sympathetic block under fluoroscopy by Pain Management and yet at the time of the preprocedure period her blood pressure was elevated at 154/118 .
The nephrologist recommended use of Clonidine 0.5 mg b.i.d. and 0.1 mg q 2 hours p.r.n.
The patient afterward however responded quite nicely and her blood pressure dropped to 104/80 .
Clearly her hypertension was labile and anxiety related .
I do not believe that she requires the standard routine daily antihypertensive medication at this time .
As mentioned earlier , the patient 's creatinine improved nicely and at the time of discharge was 1.3 .
She did have anasarca at the time of admission , but the use of Lasix and the single dialysis session that she had early during hospitalization helped mobilize that fluid .
It also helped of course to clear her lungs .
The patient was seen in consultation by Dr **NAME[PPP] from psychiatry .
During hospitalization her dialysis catheter was removed by Dr **NAME[SSS] .
At the time of discharge the patient is doing quite well .
Her dialysis catheter has been removed .
She has had a procedure for left lumbar sympathetic block under fluoroscopy .
Blood pressure will need to be followed because of variability , but she is breathing quite comfortably .
Her lungs are clear and she is doing well .
Unfortunately the patient is impulsive and therapeutically non-compliant .
There are times during this hospitalization when she left the floor against medical advice in order to smoke cigarettes .
She showed no interest in changing her overall approach to life in terms of polysubstance drug abuse .
She is being returned to **INSTITUTION Harmarville for rehabilitation training given her lower extremity weakness and pain .
