The patient is an **AGE[in 80s]- year-old white female with a history of subendocardial MI in the past , but catheterization x 3 has been without significant disease .
She has a long history of reflux esophagitis , and she is now admitted with burning chest pain and pressure yesterday after breakfast .
She also felt somewhat dyspneic and noted some burping and distention .
In the ER , her EKG showed no change and her troponins were okay .
Examination initially was unremarkable , except for epigastric discomfort on palpation .
Consultation was obtained with Cardiology .
They agreed she needed a stress test .
She underwent a stress test which was somewhat abnormal , and she therefore was sent to the catheterization lab .
Remarkably , her catheterization showed no significant coronary stenosis .
It was therefore felt that her symptoms were secondary to GERD , and she was allowed to be discharged home on a proton pump inhibitor .
Please see medication list for all of her heart medications , thyroid dosage , and blood pressure pills .
