EKG s were showing anterior wall myocardial infarction .
Her CBC and basic metabolic panel were normal .
Her cardiac enzymes were positive as expected .
Her CPK peaked to 3577 , MB to 260.7 .
On **DATE[Dec 20 2007] , her CPK was down to 381 , MB to 7.8 .
She is **AGE[in 60s]- year - old white female .

She has anterior wall hypokinesis .
Her left ventricular ejection fraction was estimated around 45% .
Left main is normal .
The LAD has subtotal thrombotic ostial occlusion .
The left circumflex artery has total proximal to mid old occlusion .
The RCA is a very large round vessel .
The posterolateral branch has mid 70% stenosis .
Coronary angioplasty / stenting of the LAD was done using 2 overlapping stents , ostial 3 x 8 - mm Cypher stent and proximal 3 x 18 - mm Cypher stent .
