DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES :
1. Multiple myeloma .
2. Status post autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplant on **DATE[Feb 2 2008] .
REASON FOR HOSPITALIZATION :
The patient is a **AGE[in 60s]- year - old female diagnosed with IgG lambda multiple myeloma in **DATE[Sep] of 2006 when she presented with anemia , sternal fracture after lifting a heavy object , and chronic back pain .
Further workup noted a hemoglobin of 8.6 , a serum protein electrophoresis of 2.9 , an IgG of 3466 , a beta - 2 microglobulin of 7.4 , a calcium of 9.6 ( unknown renal function at diagnosis ) .
A bone survey noted diffuse lytic lesions of her skull and revealed a sternal fracture at the second sternal segment .
A bone marrow biopsy was consistent with 80% plasma cells and she was treated with thalidomide , dexamethasone , and monthly Aredia .
While on thalidomide , she developed a lower extremity DVT treated with heparin and Coumadin and then subsequently changed to Lovenox .
During a hospitalization on **DATE[Dec 24 2007] , she was noted to have a decreased platelet count and her Lovenox was changed to Arixtra .
At that time , a heparin - platelet antibody was done and was noted to be negative and the heparin PF4 antibody also negative .
She did require admission to the hospital for a right lower lobe pneumonia at that time also .
She is currently admitted for conditioning and autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplant for her myeloma .
She does note that 3 days prior to admission she developed some worsening of her lower extremity edema .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
1. Multiple myeloma .
The patient was admitted and began chemotherapy with melphalan at a reduced dose of 140 mg per sq m total , which she tolerated well .
On day 0 , which was **DATE[Feb 2 2008] , she received her autologous stem cell infusion for a total dose of 2.07 times 10 to 6 CD34-positive cells , which she also tolerated well .
She engrafted her white blood cell count on day + 11 .
2. ID .
On admission , the patient began treatment with acyclovir , fluconazole , and ciprofloxacin prophylaxis .
After several days on this , she was noted to have an upper extremity rash which was thought to be related to ciprofloxacin and she was changed to prophylactic cefepime .
She did not experience a fever during the course of the hospitalization , and with recovery of her white blood cell count her antibiotics were discontinued and she remained afebrile .
3. Fluid , electrolytes , and nutrition .
During the hospitalization the patient did require multiple doses of Lasix and potassium supplementation , and was subsequently discharged on potassium oral replacement .
4. History of bilateral DVT .
The patient did continue on her Arixtra during the course of her hospitalization until her platelet count dropped below 50 .
At that time , her Arixtra was held and she was instructed to continue to hold it until she was okay to restart by Dr. **NAME[ZZZ] .
In addition , a discussion was had with Dr. **NAME[VVV UUU] from the central blood bank regarding her negative workup for HIT .
It was his opinion that given the fact that the decrease in her platelet count followed a clinical course consistent with heparin - induced thrombocytopenia , that the patient should be considered to have this disorder and have a HEPARIN ALLERGY noted on her chart , which was done .
5. Pain .
The patient during the course of the hospitalization did note an increase in her sternal pain .
At that time , a sternal x-ray was taken on **DATE[Feb 8 2008] , which noted increase angulation of the fracture at that site .
Per discussion with Dr. **NAME[TTT SSS] from cardiothoracic surgery and as the patient was having at that point little to no discomfort , it was decided to follow her fracture and if her pain increased , then she would require intervention , but at the time of discharge she had complained of no pain with movement .
6. Disposition .
On **DATE[Feb 15 2008] , she was felt to be in stable condition and prepared for discharge .

1. Acyclovir 400 mg p.o. t.i.d.
2. Calcium with vitamin D 500 mg 1 tab p.o. 3 times a day .
3. Lasix 40 mg p.o. daily .

8. The patient was again instructed to hold her Arixtra until it was okayed by Dr. **NAME[ZZZ] in the outpatient setting .
9. The patient was also instructed to take no further over - the - counter supplements until okayed by Dr. **NAME[ZZZ] or to take any further Megace with her history of lower extremity DVT s .
10. In addition , she was discharged on magnesium oxide 400 mg p.o. daily and K-Dur 20 mEq p.o. twice daily .
