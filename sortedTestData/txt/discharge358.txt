DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS :
Nausea and abdominal pain post Nissen .
This **AGE[in 30s]- year - old woman underwent an uncomplicated Nissen fundoplication for gastroesophageal reflux disease on **DATE[Mar 18 2007] , by Dr. **NAME[ZZZ] .
She was discharged home on postoperative day #2 .
Following discharge , she developed some mid back pain and also had some nausea for 2 to 3 days prior to admission .
She did not have any vomiting .
She also states that when she drank , she got quite bloated and then would have diarrhea .
This is predominantly related to food .
She denied any dysuria , fevers or chills , or respiratory symptoms .
She was assessed in the emergency department .
During the admission , a repeat upper GI was done , this showed no evidence of a leak or holdup of the contrast .
Duplex Doppler was also done to rule out PE as her heart rate has been increased .
It was felt that this was likely just due to her previous increased heart rate .
She was seen by Dr. **NAME[VVV] and started on Cardizem 120 mg while in hospital .
She will see him as an outpatient if required .
During the course of her stay , her nausea decreased , and she was able to tolerate clear fluids without any problems .
Because of the diarrhea , Clostridium difficile toxin was sent and which was not back at the time of discharge .
Otherwise , at the time of discharge , everything was well .
She is to stay on some clear fluids and slowly advance to full fluids as tolerated .
The full fluids she has tried while in the hospital did give her a bit of nausea .
She is aware to follow up in her previously booked clinic appointment with Dr. **NAME[ZZZ] and to call if any concerns develop .
