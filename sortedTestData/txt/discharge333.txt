Respiratory failure .
This is a **AGE[in 30s]- year - old woman who denies medical history was brought in unresponsive requiring intubation .
In the field for unclear reasons , apparently had been using crack cocaine and some other type of medication .

Her " boyfriend " gave her this and was transferred here for further management .
Had a relatively uneventful course .
She had some mild tachycardiac .
She has been intermittently febrile .
Appears to have an aspiration on x-ray .
She has been extubated since last evening and she has been maintaining her airway .
She has been a little sleepy but tearful as well .
Low - grade tachycardia , low - grade fever but otherwise arouses and starts talking and then gets very tearful .
It is very reticent to tell what exactly happened last night but apparently the family has mentioned that she has been suicidal for some time , depressed .

Labs were reviewed .
Electrolytes essentially unremarkable .
Mag was a little low at 1.3 .
White count was elevated 19.6 .
it was initially 31 .
Stable hemoglobin and hematocrit and platelet count .
EKG :
Slightly prolonged QTc but otherwise no QRS prolongation .
Urine drug screen positive for benzos and cocaine .
Salicylate , alcohol , acetaminophen all negative .
Chest x-ray - there appears to have some mild infiltrate .
ASSESSMENT :
1. Coma , resolved likely polysubstance .
Not exactly always everything picked up on the drug screen and could have been any type of benzodiazepine or an opiate or perhaps even diphenhydramine but it seems to be resolving regardless .
2. Respiratory failure , improved with aspiration pneumonia with leukocytosis and fever .
3. Polysubstance abuse .
PLAN :
At this time , I would agree with the IV Unasyn .
She can advance her diet as tolerated .
I have pulled the NG tube .
Watch for alcohol and benzo withdrawal .
I would start some thiamine , MVI , and folate .
I do not know her real nutrition history .
Mag of 1.3 , perhaps she is an underlying drinker as well .
Watch for signs and symptoms of benzo or alcohol withdrawal .
I would get a psychiatric consultation , probably tomorrow .
If she is okay this afternoon respiratory - wise , etc. she can likely move to a telemetry floor with a sitter to the I Service .
This was discussed with the ICU team .
