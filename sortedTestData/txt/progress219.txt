Ventilator management note :
Overnight I rested Mrs. **NAME[AAA] on assist control with a tidal volume of 500 .
Her peak airway pressures have been between 28 to 32 .
Gas exchange is stable at 40% FIO2 and 5 of PEEP .
Chest x-ray shows a slight increase in her left - sided effusion .
Yesterday she was ultrafiltrated for 2.4 L and she tolerated 10 cm water pressure support from 6 a.m. until 2 p.m.
Plan today is to have her out of bed into chair .
Continue at 10 cm of water trial pressure support for as long as tolerated .
In terms of her renal failure , BUN and creatinine are 25 and 1.3 .
She continues to make about 500 mL of urine a day .
I have increased her ACE inhibitor for her hypertension and I have switched her Synthroid to IV in light of her persistently elevated TSH .
I have ordered albumin and prealbumin to assess her nutritional status .
