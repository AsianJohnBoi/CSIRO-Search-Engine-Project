Mrs. **NAME[AAA] is an **AGE[in 80s]- year - old lady who is followed by me .
She has a history of an aortic valve replacement that I believe is a tissue valve and bypass surgery .
She has had LV dysfunction .
I believe the EF is about 35% to 40% .
Other medical problems include a past history of myocardial infarction , hypertension , and a Hodgkin 's disease , some type of leukemia .
She has had breast cancer with mastectomy , and she has also had depression , and she has had significant forgetfulness .
This patient came in the hospital today because of progressive congestion .
She was in the hospital last **DATE[May] with pneumonia , and apparently was treated , unfortunately at least according to her signs of ( _______________ ) coughing , bringing up phlegm , and was wheezing at home , and that was the issue .
I had given her a nebulizer in my office a couple of days ago , but apparently was not working for her .
This patient currently on exam is awake and alert .
She is in no acute distress .
Her blood pressure is 100/52 , heart rate is 69 .
She is afebrile .
The HEENT is negative .
Neck veins are not distended .
The carotid upstrokes are weak but normal .
No bruits are noted .
The lungs have decreased breath sounds and rhonchi bilaterally .
The heart , the aortic valve is crisp .
There is an early ejection click .
There is no S3 gallop .
S1 and S2 are normal .
There is evidence of mastectomy of the chest .
The abdomen is soft .
Extremities have no edema .
An EKG was not performed .
Labs are significant for a sodium of 142 , potassium 4.2 , BUN 32 , creatinine 1.3 , the hemoglobin is 10.2 , the hematocrit is 29.5 , the platelet count is 248,000 .
BNP is 220 .
Chest x-ray was performed in the emergency room , and it reveals an enlarged heart , clicks from previous bypass surgery .
There is some congestion in the right upper lobe .
I am not convinced that there is any infiltrate .
There are some increased interstitial markings bilaterally certainly widening to the mediastinum , but this is an AP film .
There is blunting of both costophrenic angles .
IMPRESSION :
1. Congestion in the lungs .
This patient had recent pneumonia .
She may have an exacerbation of the underlying lung disease or upper respiratory bronchitis .
She apparently was having trouble breathing at home , and her family was very concerned and brought her in .
2. Left ventricular dysfunction , coronary artery disease , coronary artery bypass graft , and a history of aortic valve replacement .
I believe it is a tissue valve .
Her BNP is in the 200s , and I do not think that she is in overt failure right now .
3. History of mastectomy and breast cancer .
4. History of some type of leukemia or non - Hodgkin 's lymphoma .
5. Senile dementia .
PLAN :
We are going to make Mrs. **NAME[AAA] very comfortable .
I know she is going to get a pulmonary consult with Dr. **NAME[VVV UUU] .
Dr. **NAME[ZZZ] is in - charge of her general medical care .
From a cardiac perspective , I do not think that there is anything acute going on right now .
Her chronic home medications will be ordered .
I spoke at length ( _______________ ) doctors .
Thank you very much for the consult .
