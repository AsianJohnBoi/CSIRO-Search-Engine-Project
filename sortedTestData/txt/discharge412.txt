The H and P are as on admission H and P , without any significant alterations or additions .
**INSTITUTION :
The patient is a very pleasant woman with an aggressive neuroendocrine carcinoma , possibly a right colon origin with extensive liver metastasis and diarrhea .
She was treated with etoposide and cisplatin therapy for this particular problem .
Her prognosis is very grave .
She was given treatment and started on Neupogen therapy for support .
She continued to remain very weak .
We started her on G-CSF as soon as her chemotherapy was completed .
She continued to be followed by the medical services in addition to our service .
Her pain was controlled with narcotic therapy as necessary .
Her bilirubin still remained elevated , in spite of an attempt at chemotherapy .
We continued supportive care , and the patient continued to have pain .
The family visited the patient , and after discussion with them , ultimately it was found that they did not wish any further resuscitative measures .
She developed sepsis when she developed neutropenia .
She was started on antibiotic therapy with Maxipime , along with the Neupogen .
She was given some IV Lasix for acute respiratory distress .
In spite of all these measures , she subsequently declined , and the family wished her to have only hospice care , and certainly at this point in time that was a reasonable approach in view of the fact that it did not appear that she had any significant chance for significant recovery .
She was subsequently transferred to the hospice service .
