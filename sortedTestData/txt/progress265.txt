We had done a vaginal exam when she was having her period that is now resolved .
We are going to have a talk with Gynecology to see if we can get the appointment with her to go to the clinic , right after discharge to make sure that she does not have a fistulous track that is developed but we could not see when we had taken her down to our clinic and look for __________ defects .
3. Abnormal uptake in her sacrum .
We are going to discuss with ID , if they think that we should proceed with biopsy in that area as well .
Her case was discussed in detail with house staff .
I agree with their note as written .
