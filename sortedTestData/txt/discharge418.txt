HISTORY :
This is the first recent **INSTITUTION admission for this **AGE[in 60s]- year - old female who noted the onset of an expressive , nonfluent aphasia on the day of admission .
The patient also has severe end - stage COPD .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted .
She had some expressive aphasia which lasted several days .
She had an MRI which showed no significant change , previous 2 meningiomas , one of which is impinging upon the brain stem , the other of which is in the left temporal region .
She had an EEG which also demonstrated some slowing but no focal spiking .
Both Dr. **NAME[XXX] and Dr. **NAME[WWW] of neurosurgery felt that the symptoms were more likely related to a TIA or RIND .
The patient declined surgical intervention for her meningiomas .
Given her medical condition with severe COPD , consultants thought that this is a reasonable decision .
The patient 's neurologic status gradually improved to baseline .
She has basically a bed - to - chair existence because of her severe COPD , but she was able to return to baseline .
