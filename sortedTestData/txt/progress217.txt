Ventilator management note .
I am managing this **AGE[in 60s]- year - old female with respiratory and renal failure after a sternectomy for mediastinitis .
Ms. **NAME[CCC] is awake and alert this morning .
Yesterday she was able to go for about 6 hours on a pressure support of 15 .
I have rested overnight on assist control .
The peak airway pressures are in the mid 20s , gas exchange is good at 40% FIO2 , and 5 of PEEP , minute ventilation is 8 to 10 liters .
The chest x-ray shows stable bilateral effusions with no significant change .
This morning I placed her on a pressure support of 10 and she has done well through most of the day .
I will plan to rest her back on assist control this evening and drop her pressure support again tomorrow .
In terms of her mediastinitis , she is continuing a course of Cefepime and Vancomycin .
Clinically she is improving .
I have increased her ACE inhibitor today for some better blood pressure control .
She is adequately beta blocked on the current dose of Carvedilol , with heart rates in the 60s to 70s .
I have ordered a repeat thyroid functions test in light of relatively elevated TSH level , which I am not sure is correct .
I have also increased her scheduled insulin for better glycemic control .
