I personally interviewed and examined the patient and discussed the case with the house staff team .
The patient feels much better today .
He notes that he is having bowel movements .
He is actually hungry and ate breakfast without problem .
His NG tube is out since yesterday , and he has had no recurrence of the significant abdominal pain and distention .
He still does not feel back to normal .
He still feels that he is somewhat bloated , but the pain is much better .
He does however note that he is coughing up much more sputum , and he feels much more congested in his chest .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
Blood pressure 154/80 , pulse is in the 80s , respirations are 18 , and he is afebrile .
Examination of his lungs reveals increased crackles and rhonchi in the right lower lobe that is worse than yesterday .
Some of it clears with cough but not completely .
The rest of his lung fields are relatively unremarkable .
His cardiac exam is unremarkable .
His abdominal exam has normal bowel sounds .
It is soft .
It is essentially nontender today and is less distended .
LABORATORIES :
His electrolytes , BUN , and creatinine were normal .
White blood cell count was 3800 with a marked left shift .
He has 21% neutrophils and 34% bands .
Chest x-ray from yesterday revealed small patchy bilateral atelectasis , but no evidence of specific consolidation .
IMPRESSION :
1. Partial small bowel obstruction .
He clearly is moving his bowels .
He feels better .
He has been passing gas and stool .
There is no evidence of significant obstruction by exam .
2. Upper respiratory tract infection .
He felt that lot of this started with an upper respiratory tract infection , which he feels he picked up at work , however , he is having more sputum production and chest congestion .
He had a bilateral lower lobe atelectasis by x-ray but now has a profound bandemia on his white blood cell count .
I would suggest we start with a repeat chest x-ray to make sure there has not been progression of an infiltrate in his lungs .
