ATTENDING PHYSICIAN :
**NAME[YYY M ZZZ]
ADMISSION DATE :
**DATE[Sep 07 2007]
EVALUATION DATE :
**DATE[Sep 09 07]
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is doing about the same today .
She was seen by Vascular and they were trying to take her to the OR tomorrow .
She continues to complain of some dizziness when she gets up quickly .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
On her exam today , the finger - nose was on target .
There was mild symmetric drift .
Her upper extremity strength was 5/5 .
Lower extremity strength was also 5/5 with exception of some mild proximal weakness in her shoulders .
Her tandem walking , she is unable to do but she is able to stand and walk on her heels and her toes .
We tried to do a BNA when we took her back .
She developed profound dizziness , had to close her eyes and sat back up .
It looked like a positive test but she would not let us evaluate her eyes for nystagmus .
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN :
1. Increased sedimentation rate , increased WBC count , and anemia .
She is to undergo temporal artery biopsy .
We discussed her case with Rheumatology .
They suggested repeating her EMG nerve conduction study in case her biopsy is negative .
We already have those tests on board as we may proceed with muscle nerve biopsy and bone marrow biopsy as well .
2. Vertigo .
Her symptoms are somehow suggestive of a peripheral vertigo , probably benign positional vertigo but given Rheumatology 's assessment that she has some asymmetric sensory abnormality , we will set her for an MRI scan of her brain and will be seen in the **INSTITUTION for 4 more vestibular function tests once we get some , I think , more important tests first .
The case was discussed in detail with house staff .
I agree with their note as written .
My note should be considered linked to theirs .
