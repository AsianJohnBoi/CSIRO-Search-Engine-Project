SEVERE BILATERAL BULLOUS EMPHYSEMA STATUS POST BILATERAL LUNG VOLUME REDUCTION SURGERY .
REASON FOR ADMISSION :
Brief history and physical - This patient is a **AGE[in 60s]- year - old female who was seen in the office of Dr. **NAME[ZZZ] approximately one year ago in **DATE[Feb] of 2006 .
At this time , she presented to the clinic for evaluation for possible lung volume reduction surgery .
LABORATORY / RADIOGRAPHIC FINDINGS :
Procedures performed -
On **DATE[Feb 29 2007] , the patient underwent a flexible bronchoscopy , bilateral lung volume reduction surgery , lysis of adhesions at the left and right pleural space , and insertion of mini tracheostomy tube .
On **DATE[Mar 01 2007] , the patient underwent a percutaneous tracheostomy .
On **DATE[Mar 14 2007] , the patient underwent a bedside bronchoscopy .
On **DATE[Mar 26 2007] , the patient underwent flexible bronchoscopy , percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube placement , and tracheostomy change .
On **DATE[Mar 27 2007] , the patient underwent a bedside flexible bronchoscopy .
On **DATE[Apr 15 2007] , the patient underwent tracheal dilation and tracheostomy exchange for #6 Shiley tracheostomy at the bedside .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient went through all three phases of the lung volume reduction surgery program and is deemed a candidate by her pulmonary function tests and after discussion of her individual case at the Multidisciplinary Lung Volume Reduction Surgery meeting .
The patient came to the hospital on **DATE[Feb 29 2007] and underwent bilateral lung volume reduction surgery .
This patient has had significant postoperative complications since her initial surgery .
She required mechanical ventilation for several days postoperatively .
The patient also had a complication of a small tracheal - bronchial tear .
Due to her prolonged need for mechanical ventilation , the patient was taken back to the Operating Room on **DATE[Mar 01 2007] for insertion of tracheostomy tube .
The patient had postoperative cardiac complications of V-tach and atrial fibrillation requiring a Cardizem drip in the early postoperative period .
The patient did have some acute abdominal pain and a CT of the abdomen revealed three gallstones .
In addition , the patient had right upper quadrant pain and nausea .
At this time , Trauma Surgery was consulted .
The patient was not a candidate for surgery at this time and she was treated conservatively .
The patient also had a postoperative complication of positive blood cultures requiring IV vancomycin .
The patient had a duplex scan on **DATE[Mar 14 2007] which revealed a focal DVT in the right lower extremity .
At this time , anticoagulation was started with Coumadin .
At one point , the patient was tolerating ventilation through her trach mask but did have several episodes that required her to be put back on full mechanical support .
A CT scan done on **DATE[Mar 20 2007] for respiratory insufficiency requiring the patient to be put back on ventilation .
The CT scan showed a right effusion at this time .
We consulted IR .
IR placed a pigtail under ultrasound guidance on **DATE[Mar 21 2007] .
Due to the patient 's failure to wean and keeping her N.P.O. , the patient underwent percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube placement on **DATE[Mar 26 2007] .
Her tube feeds were started two days later and were tolerated well .
At the end of **DATE[Mar] of 2007 , the patient went into acute renal failure .
At first , a torsemide drip was started on **DATE[Mar 22 2007] .
At first , this created a good urine output response ; however , the BUN and creatinine continued to rise .
At this time , dialysis was started .
The patient was put on Prisma initially .
Due to the patient 's DVT , she was on Coumadin ; however , we had discontinued this due to her multiple medical problems .
Since we opted not to anticoagulate her further , the patient went to Interventional Radiology on **DATE[Mar 26 2007] for placement of an IVC filter .
The patient did have some complications due to dialysis - including severe hypotension .
The patient did require Levophed on and off over about three to four weeks ' time .
The patient was getting dialysis every other day .
There was some trouble getting off as much fluid as was necessary .
The patient 's respiratory status did improve the last few weeks of **DATE[Apr] as she was able to be on the trach mask without mechanical ventilatory support for approximately 10 to 14 days .
However , on **DATE[May 01 2007] , the patient became septic with increasing respiratory insufficiency that would require her return to full mechanical ventilatory support .
She also went into atrial fibrillation .
At this time , the patient 's condition worsened significantly .
After several discussions with the patient and family which took place prior to the recent events above , a decision had already been made not to escalate medical support should her condition worsen and provide her with comfort .
Therefore , the family decided to make the patient comfort measure only .
The time of death for the patient was 10:36 a.m. on **DATE[May 01 2007] .
