EVALUATION DATE :
**DATE[Apr 28 07]
I am currently seeing this **AGE[in 50s]- year - old patient with a prolonged ICU course and status postop bilateral lung reduction surgery .
The remainder of her respiratory insufficiency , renal failure , volume overload , electrolyte abnormality hypophosphatemia and neutropenia .
I examined her , reviewed her laboratory data , chart data and chest x-ray .
She hemodynamically has remained hemodynamically stable for the most part .
She has tolerated volume removal anywhere from a 100 to 150 mL off and hour .
She is in a sinus rhythm with a heart rate in the 80s .
She is clinically warm and well - perfused .
From a respiratory standpoint , she continues off the vent since **DATE[Apr 23 07] .
She is doing well from this standpoint with 40% trach mask .
Saturations were 97 to 100% .
From a renal electrolyte standpoint , her clearance has _______ CVVHDF .
As previously mentioned , we were removing 100 to 150 mL off an hour .
Her phosphate was 2.1 , which I did supplement .
Otherwise , the other concern is that the patient is neutropenic .
ANC is 750 .
The only thing I can see that would cause neutropenia in her drug profile was the Flagyl , so as she has had no C diff. I did discontinue this and did not feel obligated to switch her over to vancomycin as she has had no history of C. diff.
I did put her on Culturelle .
I did give her a dose of Neupogen and we will follow her white count in the morning .
Otherwise , she is on enteral nutrition support , which she is tolerating .
Her hemoglobin is stable .
There is no evidence of bleeding .
She is on DVT and GI prophylaxis .
Otherwise , continue her current supportive care and management .
CRITICAL CARE TIME IS 32 MINUTES .
