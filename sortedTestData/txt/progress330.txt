EVALUATION DATE :
**DATE[Apr 01 07]
I am seeing this critically ill patient for continued management of multiple medical problems including respiratory failure , acute renal failure , and hyperglycemia .
I have seen and examined this patient .
I have reviewed the chest x-ray and laboratory data , and I have discussed the patient 's care with the SICU team and the Thoracic Surgery service .
Mrs. **NAME[AAA] is continuing to improve slowly .
She is on assist control 40% FIO2 and 5 of PEEP now with peak inspiratory pressures in the 20-25 range .
She is on 400 ml tidal volume .
She is starting CPAP trials today and will see how these go .
She has not been able to tolerate weaning trials as yet , but we have removed significant amounts of fluid on dialysis over the last few days .
She continues to require hydrocortisone for blood pressure , developing hypotension when we wean this , and it is clear that she would not tolerate increased volume removal on intermittent hemodialysis .
I have spoken to nephrology , and we have decided to switch to CVVH for additional fluid removal .
She is afebrile .
Her white blood cell count is 10 .
Her left lower extremity is edematous and red but does not appear to show cellulitis .
Glucoses are up , partly related to the increase in hydrocortisone .
I have increased her sliding scale and started her on NPH insulin today .
T = 40 minutes .
