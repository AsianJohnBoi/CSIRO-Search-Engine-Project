Hospital Course
Hospital Course
Patient statistics :
**AGE[in 40s] year old .
Admitted : from emergency department .
Admitting diagnosis : right groin swelling .
Admission disposition : admit to medical bed .
HPI - **AGE[in 40s] yo male came to ED with right groin swelling .
Brief recent history
- ESRD , on transplant list .
Came in for transplant on **DATE[Sep 3 07] , but was found to have elevated alk phos an tbili , so was unable to be transplanted on that day , and was taken off of the list pending hepatology workup .
This far , workup has been negative , including MRCP .
Was admitted to Latrobe hospital from **DATE[Nov 1 07] until **DATE[Nov 10 07] for RUE swelling .
On angioplasty ( through the right brachial vein ) , was found to have NO DVT - the right inominate vein was stenotic , so was stented .
This was felt to be due to TDC presence , however , access is an issue with thsi gentelman , so the catheter was left in place , and anticoagulation was started .
During the Latrobe hospitalization , on either 1/8 or 1/9 , right groin swelling started .
Doppler was negative for DVT or hematoma , and he was discharged to his persnal care home .
Mr. **NAME[AAA] presented to presby ED on 1/15 with continued right groin swelling and pain .
Extensive review of Latrobe records revealed no history of groin line placement , and patient reports none .
There is no evidence on exam of a goin line or use for blood draw .
1. Right groin swelling - Ultrasound on 1/16 showed organized hematoma 1.2 x 2.86 cm .
Both general and vascular surgery consult also felt that the exam was c/w hematoma , and not concerning for vascular malformation .
Recommended observation .
MRI on 1/17 of the LE showed diabetic myonecrosis , concerning for inflammation or infection .
No fluid collection or abscess is visualized .
Clinical picture is not concerning for infection ( afebrile , WBC normal ) so inflammation of the muscles is most likely .
Recommend rest until symptoms improve , leg elevation , wheelchair with footrests for transport beyond walking to the restroom , etc .
In terms of follow up , would recommend CBC three times per week and physical exam by nursing home physician to be sure that an infection does not develop .
If symptoms worsen , if Mr. **NAME[AAA] becomes febrile , this is concerning for infection or worsening inflammation .
2. RUE swelling - Recent baloon opening of stenotic right inominate vein .
Doppler was repeated 1/17 , which showed patent vessels .
Will send patient home on continued anticoagulation , and will defer to PCP on whether to continue anticoagulation in the absence of DVT .
Continue to check INR while on Coumadin .
3. Renal - continued hemodialysis MWF as per home schedule , with IV iron .
Also continued home phosphate binders .
Consider low glucose Boost ( or equivalent ) TID as an outpatient to maintain adequate BUN .
4. Endocrine - Mr. **NAME[AAA] has a history of difficult to control glucose .
Was kept on home regimen of insulin , plus SSI , and will be discharged with same .
5. ID - At Latrobe hospital , Mr. **NAME[AAA] was found to have CoNS bacteremia , and was treated with vancomycin .
