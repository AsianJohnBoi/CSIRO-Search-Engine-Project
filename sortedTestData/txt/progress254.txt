I am seeing this critically ill man for management of hemodynamic instability , cardiomyopathy , respiratory insufficiency , mechanical ventilatory support , and hyperglycemia .
I have examined the patient and reviewed the laboratory data , chest x-ray film and events of evening .
He is status post coronary revascularization with impaired ventricular function and a history of significant vascular disease .
They were unable to put in a balloon pump in the OR .
Hemodynamically , we have continued him on milrinone and epinephrine , currently at 0.4 of milrinone and epinephrine at 0.125 .
I am going to start to try to wean the epinephrine if possible at this point given his age and his vascular disease as long as his cardiac index remains acceptable .
He is positive 4 liters , but his CVP is only running about 13 to 14 .
From a radiographic standpoint , he has some slight haziness bilaterally , but he has a reasonable A-a gradient .
He was rested on full mechanical support .
I have given him a CPAP trial , and I would favor giving him a trial of extubation .
I have him on an insulin infusion for glycemic control .
Pain control remains acceptable , and chest tube drainage is modest .
Continue supportive care as above .
T = 35 .
