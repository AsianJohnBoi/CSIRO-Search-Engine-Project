EVALUATION DATE :
**DATE[May 03 07]
I personally interviewed and examined the patient .
The care plan was discussed with the resident team .
Please consider this note linked to the resident note .
The patient has had an uneventful night .
She declined ambulating with physical therapy yesterday .
She says she is too tired .
She did state that she is having discomfort in her left knee .
This is increased over the last several days .
She states this is not why she is not wanting to walk .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
Blood pressure is 157/56 and temperature is 37.0 .
In general , she is a chronically ill - appearing woman , brighter affect , wearing glasses today and watching television .
She is in no acute distress .
Lungs are clear to auscultation .
Mouth is without lesions .
Skin exam is unchanged .
LABORATORY DATA :
Labs are detailed in the resident note and reviewed by me in their entirety .
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN
1. Heme .
She has positive lupus anticoagulant .
To my knowledge , she has never had a history of DVT or pulmonary embolism , which would indicate right lung or even would indicate the need for anticoagulation .
Her legs are unimpressive for DVT at this time , and I would , however , in light of knee pain , consider Doppler , although the yield would be low .
2. Left knee pain .
Rheumatology is following .
Will ask whether they think arthrocentesis is indicated .
Joint is not warm to touch , but is tender , and there is a slight effusion .
She has decreased flexion secondary to pain .
3. ID .
Changing to Augmentin today .
