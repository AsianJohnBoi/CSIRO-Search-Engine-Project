**INSTITUTION PROGRESS NOTE
The patient was seen on **DATE[Dec 15 2007] .
I personally interviewed and examined Mr. **NAME[AAA] this morning and discussed the case with Dr. **NAME[RRR] .
I agree with the findings , impression , and plan , as indicated in Dr. **NAME[RRR] 's admission history and physical and please consider this note linked to his .
Mr. **NAME[AAA] is an **AGE[in 80s]- year - old man who has had multiple abdominal surgeries including colectomy , appendectomy , and multiple small bowel obstructions who presented with one - day history of increasing abdominal pain and distention .
He states that he ate a very big meal yesterday and thereafter began to develop increasing abdominal distention and pain .
In the emergency department at an outlying hospital , he was found by CT scan to have what appeared to be a small bowel obstruction .
He did have one small bowel movement there but was transferred here for admission .
On admission to the floor , he also has had another bowel movement and has been passing gas .
He was also placed on IV hydration , nasogastric suction , and feels better this morning. In fact , he has no significant complaints this morning with the exception of the feeling of distention and the discomfort of the NG tube .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
1. He has had multiple abdominal surgeries as indicated in his MARS records and electronic medical record .
2. He had an appendectomy many years ago .
3. He had a partial colectomy for a benign tumor .
4. He has had an abdominal aortic aneurysm repair .
5. He has had aortic valve repair .
6. He has had multiple small bowel obstructions .
7. He also has a long - standing history of hypertension .
FAMILY HISTORY :
Family history is significant for a father with colon cancer and a mother who had coronary artery disease .
SOCIAL HISTORY :
His social history is remarkable for the fact that he is still working at 83 .
He is a welder and iron worker for a large coal processing plant on the river .
He does not smoke .
He recently is widowed in **DATE[Feb] of this year when his wife passed away .
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS :
Review of systems is otherwise unremarkable except as in the HPI .
MEDICATIONS :
Medications are as indicated on the admission history and physical and orders .
EXAMINATION :
He is afebrile .
His blood pressure is 165/77 , his heart rate is 86 , his respiratory rate is normal .
His head and neck examination is unremarkable .
His mucous membranes are moist .
His neck is supple .
He has no adenopathy .
His lungs are clear to auscultation and percussion .
There are no wheezes , rhonchi , or rales .
His cardiac examination reveals aortic valve sounds with a soft murmur .
His abdominal examination is distended .
It is tympanitic .
There are normal bowel sounds , however , and there is no significant tenderness to palpation .
His extremities have no edema .
LABORATORIES :
Electrolytes , BUN , and creatinine are unremarkable with the exception of slightly elevated BUN of 24 .
White blood cell count is 8,900 , hemoglobin and hematocrit are normal .
He has 82% neutrophils .
His PT and PTT are slightly abnormal at 14.4 and 40.1 .
IMPRESSION :
1. NAUSEA , VOMITING , ABDOMINAL PAIN :
I suspect this is a partial small bowel obstruction from adhesions from his multiple prior surgeries .
We will continue hydration .
He can discontinue nasogastric suction today as he is passing gas through his rectum and has had small bowel movements .
We will continue to advance his diet as tolerated and if he continues to improve , he may be discharged soon .
2. ANTICOAGULATION :
He was anticoagulated many years ago for DVT and PE after crush injury to his left leg .
His Coumadin is subtherapeutic and we will adjust doses today .
3. HYPERTENSION :
His blood pressure is poorly controlled .
We will make sure he is on a stable regimen of his outpatient medications .
If that is not sufficient , we will increase his medicines .
