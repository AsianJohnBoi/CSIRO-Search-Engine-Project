I have been requested by Dr. **NAME[ZZZ] to take care of this patient admitted to the ICU .
I am managing this patient 's respiratory failure , hyperglycemia , hypertension , and infectious disease .
The patient is status post lung reduction surgery from today .
Intraoperatively the patient 's course has been complicated by two tracheal tears - one in the trachea about 5 cm above the carina and the second one in the left main bronchus probably related to the double - lumen endotracheal tube in the Operating Room .
The patient was left intubated since she was severely acidotic coming out of the Operating Room .
On arrival to the ICU , the patient 's first blood gas revealed a pH of 7.16 , pCO2 in the 80s , and pO2 in the 188 range on 50% FiO2 and 5 of PEEP .
On my examination initially , all four chest tubes were on water - seal .
She did have some subcutaneous air on the left side that was starting to get transmitted to the right side , too .
Her x-ray showed a loculated left upper lobe pneumothorax .
A chest tube was in position although it was not on suction .
After talking to the Surgical team , I placed a left - sided chest tube to 10 cm of suction .
The right - sided chest tubes are still on water - seal at the present time .
The right side chest tube has some air leak .
The left side air leak has actually gotten better .
A repeat x-ray shows decrease in the left - sided pneumothorax .
I initially tried to ventilate this patient with CPAP 5 and pressure support of 15 .
Despite having minute volumes of around 5 liters , the patient 's pCO2 was not getting better .
Her PA s consistently remained the same .
I subsequently initiated 2 liters of transrectal gas insufflation through the mini tracheostomy tube and subsequent to which appear to have gotten better .
Her pCO2 is down to 67 .
I will continue the current treatment modalities .
I have , hence , left her intubated because of her severe acidosis .
The endotracheal tube is distal to the tracheal tear but proximal , obviously , to the left main bronchial tear .
I have continued her on Lopressor for hypertension and Unasyn for antibiotic prophylaxis .
Her sugars have been in the 300 range .
I have , hence , initiated insulin infusion for tight glycemic control .
I have given her p.r.n. fentanyl for pain .
I have in the meanwhile continued her on prednisone and theophylline .
She is on 100 mg of hydrocortisone for stress - dose steroids which is probably causing her hyperglycemia .
Her potassium is 5.5 which I think is probably related to the acidosis .
I will continue to follow it .
She currently has no EKG manifestations .
The total critical care time I provided on this patient is **AGE[in 30s] minutes .
