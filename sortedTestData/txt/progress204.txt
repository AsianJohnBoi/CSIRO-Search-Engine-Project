ADMISSION DATE :

EVALUATION DATE :
**DATE[Mar 14 07]
I am managing this critically ill , **AGE[in 60s]- year - old female , status post mediastinal debridement for mediastinitis , hospital course complicated by respiratory failure , fluid overload , and renal insufficiency .
I am seeing her for management of these issues .
I have seen and examined the patient , reviewed her laboratory , radiographic , and Emtek data , and discussed the management with the plastic surgeons .
Problems and management are as follows :
1. Respiratory failure .
Chest x-ray shows a significant increase in the right - sided effusion .
The left effusion is resolved significantly after the pigtail on the left side .
On the vent , I have got her on assist control .
Her peak airway pressures , minute ventilation , and gas exchange have been adequate .
The plan today is for a right - sided pleural pigtail under ultrasound guidance , followed by a pressure support trial .
2. Oliguria .
BUN and creatinine are up today at 72 and 2.6 with some decrease in urine output .
We have been diuresing her aggressively , and I suspect that her intervascular volume is depleted .
I have given her a fluid bolus and held her Lasix .
3. Mediastinitis .
White blood cell count remains 20,000 .
She is on cefepime and vancomycin .
I have ordered a repeat vancomycin trough today .
4. ICU prophylaxis .
She is being tube fed at goal rate and strength .
I have her on an insulin drip for tight glycemic control .
Total critical care time equals 40 minutes , excluding procedures .
PROCEDURE NOTE :
The procedure is right pleural pigtail .
The indication is respiratory failure and right - sided pleural effusion .
The patient is rolled with the right side up .
The ultrasound is used to locate a large pocket of fluid in the right pleural cavity .
The site is prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion , and using ultrasound guidance , the pleural space is accessed on the first pass with the needle .
The wire , dilator , and pigtail catheter are advanced via Seldinger technique without complication and sutured into place .
A portable chest x-ray is pending .
I was present for and supervised the entire procedure .
