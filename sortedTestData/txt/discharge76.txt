CT scan revealed a collection of fluid around an enlarged left axillary lymph node .
The collection was incised and drained by General Surgery and specimen sent to Microbiology for bacterial and fungal cultures , results which are pending .
The patient improved clinically following the procedure .
Given the patient 's clinical improvement on doxycycline and status post I and D , the patient was discharged home to follow up with his PCP in 4 days .

CMV , and Brucella .
